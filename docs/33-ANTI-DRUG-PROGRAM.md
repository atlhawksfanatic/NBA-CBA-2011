If a player is suspended or disqualified for conduct involving a Drug of Abuse or marijuana, the NBA shall not publicly disclose the particular Prohibited Substance involved, absent the agreement of the Players Association or the prior disclosure of such information by the player (or by a person authorized by the player to disclose such information). If a player is suspended or disqualified for conduct involving a SPED, the particular SPED shall be publicly disclosed along with the announcement of the applicable penalty.

(c) The Independent Expert is prohibited from publicly disclosing any information supplied to him by the NBA or the Players Association pursuant to Section 5 below.
(d) Members of the Prohibited Substances Committee are prohibited from publicly disclosing any information obtained by them in connection with their duties as Committee members. If a jointly-selected member of the Committee violates this Section 3(d), he shall be immediately discharged from the Committee.
(e) Any Program Information that is publicly disclosed (i) under Section 3(a) above, (ii) by the player, (iii) with the player's authorization, or (iv) through release by sources other than the NBA, NBA Teams, the Players Association, the Medical Director, the Counselors, the Independent Expert, or the Prohibited Substances Committee, or any of their members, affiliates, agents, consultants, and employees, will, after such disclosure, no longer be subject to the confidentiality provisions of this Section 3.
(f) Other than as reasonably required by the Reasonable Cause Testing procedure set forth in Section 5 below, neither the NBA nor the Players Association shall divulge to any other person or entity (including their respective members, affiliates, agents, consultants, employees, and the player and Team involved):
    (i) that it has received information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance by a player;

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 3(a)-(f) above, the NBA and the Players Association shall promptly advise and make available to each other all information either of them may have in their possession, custody, or control that provides cause to believe that a player is engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance.
(h) Nothing contained in this Section 3 shall prohibit a Team from providing to the NBA information concerning whether a player is engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance.

## Testing.

(a) Testing conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII, whether by the NBA or the Medical Director, shall be conducted in compliance with scientifically accepted analytical techniques. Such testing shall also comply with the collection procedures described in Exhibit I-3 (for urine collections) to this Agreement and such additional procedures and protocols as may be established by the NBA (after consultation with the Players Association) or the Medical Director (after consultation with the NBA and the Players Association). The NBA and the Medical Director (after consultation with the Players Association) are authorized to retain such consultants and support services as are necessary and appropriate to administer and conduct such testing.
(b) All tests conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII shall be analyzed by laboratories selected by the NBA and the Players Association, approved by the Medical Director, and certified by the World Anti-Doping Agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), or the International Olympic Committee.
(c) Any test conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII will be considered "positive" for a Prohibited Substance under the following circumstances:
    (i) If the test is for a Prohibited Substance other than a SPED or Diuretic and it is confirmed by laboratory analysis at the levels established at the time of the test by SAMHSA; provided, however, if there is no confirmatory level established by SAMHSA for one or more of such Prohibited Substances at the time of the test, then the level for such Prohibited Substance shall be: amphetamines and their analogs—500 ng/ml; cocaine metabolites—150 ng/ml; LSD—200 pg/ml; marijuana metabolites—15 ng/ml; MDMA—500 ng/ml; opiate metabolites—2,000 ng/ml; heroin metabolite (6-acetylmorphine)—10 ng/ml (only if the opiate metabolites are in excess of 2,000 ng/ml); and phencyclidine—25 ng/ml.
    (ii) If the test is for a SPED, and it is confirmed by laboratory analysis at the levels set forth in Exhibit I-4.
    (iii) If a player refuses to submit to a test or cooperate fully with the testing process, without a reasonable explanation satisfactory to the Medical Director; provided, however, that the NBA will use its best efforts (A) to have the drug testing collectors immediately notify the NBA when any player refuses to submit to a test or cooperate fully with the testing process, and (B) to provide such information to the Players Association as soon as possible thereafter; and provided, further, that (C) following any player's refusal to submit to a test or failure to cooperate fully with the testing process, the drug testing collector shall wait ninety (90) minutes at the collection site, and (D) if the player submits to the test and cooperates fully with the testing process within such additional time, then his earlier refusal or failure to cooperate shall be excused and the test shall not be deemed positive under this Section 4(c).
    (iv) If the player fails to submit to a scheduled test, without a reasonable explanation satisfactory to the Medical Director.
    (v) If the player attempts to substitute, dilute, or adulterate a specimen sample or in any other manner alter a test result (other than by testing positive for a Diuretic).
    (vi) If the test is positive for a Diuretic, and it is confirmed by laboratory analysis at any detectable level.
(d) The NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association of any positive test conducted by the NBA, and shall thereafter notify the player. The Medical Director shall promptly notify the player of any positive test conducted by the Medical Director; provided, however, that if the positive test will result in a penalty to be imposed on the player, the Medical Director shall notify the NBA and the Players Association of the positive test result and the NBA shall thereafter notify the player of such result and such penalty.
(e) Any player who is notified of a positive test pursuant to Section 4(d) above may, within five (5) business days of such notification, inform the NBA and the Players Association that he requests testing of the split or "B" sample of his specimen. The test of the "B" sample will be performed at a laboratory other than the laboratory that performed the test on the original or "A" sample. Any such test shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 4 and shall be sent to the laboratory for testing within ten (10) business days of the player's request.
(f) Any positive test pursuant to Sections 4(c)(i), (ii), or (vi) above shall be reviewed by the Medical Director. If the Medical Director determines, in his professional judgment, that there is a valid alternative medical explanation for such positive test result, then the test shall be deemed negative.
(g) If the test result for any player is reported by the laboratory as "invalid" or "endogenous steroids abnormally low," the NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association, and shall thereafter notify the player. In the event of such a test result, the player shall be required to submit to another test on a date determined by the NBA that is not more than thirty (30) days after the date of the original test (the "Re-Test"). If the Re-Test results in (i) a positive test for a Drug of Abuse or a positive test under Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above, the player shall be immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below; (ii) a positive test for marijuana, the player shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 8 below; or (iii) a positive test for a SPED or Diuretic, the player shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 below. The original test will not be counted towards the number of tests to be administered to that player for that Season under Section 6 (Random Testing) below.

## Reasonable Cause Testing or Hearing.

(a) In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association has information that gives it reasonable cause to believe that a player is engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, including information that a First-Year Player may have been engaged in such conduct during the period beginning three (3) months prior to his entry into the NBA, such party shall request a conference with the other party and the Independent Expert, which shall be held within twenty-four (24) hours or as soon thereafter as the Expert is available. Upon hearing the information presented, the Independent Expert shall immediately decide whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the player in question has been engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance. If the Independent Expert decides that such reasonable cause exists, the Expert shall thereupon issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to such player.
(b) In evaluating the information presented to him, the Independent Expert shall use his independent judgment based upon his experience in substance abuse detection and enforcement. The parties acknowledge that the type of information to be presented to the Independent Expert is likely to consist of reports of conversations with third parties of the type generally considered by law enforcement authorities to be reliable sources, and that such sources might not otherwise come forward if their identities were to become known. Accordingly, neither the NBA nor the Players Association shall be required to divulge to each other or to the Independent Expert the names (or other identifying characteristics) of their sources of information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, and the absence of such identification of sources, standing alone, shall not constitute a basis for the Expert to refuse to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to a player. In conferences with the Independent Expert, the player involved shall not be identified by name until such time as the Expert has determined to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to such player in the form set forth in Exhibit I-1 to this Agreement.
(c) Immediately upon the Independent Expert's issuance of an Authorization for Testing with respect to a particular player, the NBA shall arrange for such player to undergo testing for Drugs of Abuse (if the Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Drug of Abuse), for marijuana (if the authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player's use, possession, or distribution of marijuana), or for SPEDs (if the Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player's use, possession, or distribution of a SPED) no more than four (4) times during the six-week period commencing with the issuance of the Authorization for Testing. Such testing may be administered at any time, in the discretion of the NBA, without prior notice to the player.
(d) In the event that the player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse pursuant to this Section 5, or tests positive pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above in connection with testing conducted pursuant to this Section 5, he shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below. If the player tests positive for marijuana or a SPED pursuant to this Section 5, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall suffer the applicable consequences of a positive test for the Prohibited Substance for which the Authorization for Testing was issued.
(e) In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association determines that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that, within the previous year, a player has engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, or has received treatment for use of a Prohibited Substance other than in accordance with the terms of this Article XXXIII, it may, in lieu of requesting the testing procedure set forth in Section 5(a)-(d) above, request a hearing on the matter before the Grievance Arbitrator. If the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that, within the previous year, the Player has used, possessed, or distributed a Prohibited Substance, or has received treatment other than in accordance with the terms of this Article XXXIII, the player shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below, notwithstanding the fact that the player has not undergone the testing procedure set forth in this Section 5; provided, however, that if the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that the player has used or possessed marijuana or a SPED, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may be.

## Random Testing.

(a) In addition to the testing procedures set forth in Section 5 above, a player shall be required to undergo testing for Prohibited Substances at any time, without prior notice to the player, no more than four (4) times each Season and no more than two (2) times during each Off-Season. During each Season, the NBA will conduct no more than 1,525 total tests. During the Off-Season, the NBA will conduct no more than 600 total tests. The scheduling of testing and collection of urine samples will be conducted according to a random player selection procedure by a third-party organization, and neither the NBA, the Players Association, any Team or any player will have any involvement in selecting the players to be tested or will receive prior notice of the testing schedule; provided, however, that it shall not be a violation of the foregoing for the third-party organization (or a specimen collector for the same) to provide advance notice of a scheduled collection to an NBA Team Security Representative, so long as such notice does not identify the player(s) who will be tested and seeks merely to facilitate access of the collector to the testing location. Urine samples collected during the Season will be tested for all Prohibited Substances; urine samples collected during the Off-Season will be tested for SPEDs and Diuretics only and may not under any circumstances be tested with respect to any other Prohibited Substances.
(b) (i) In the event that a First-Year Player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse pursuant to this Section 6, he shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or its Teams for a period of one (1) year, his Player Contract shall be rendered null and void and of no further force or effect (subject to the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Uniform Player Contract), and he shall enter Stage 1 of the Drugs of Abuse Program. Such dismissal and disqualification shall be mandatory and may not be rescinded or reduced by the player's Team or the NBA.
    (ii) During any period while a First-Year Player is dismissed and disqualified from the NBA under Section 6(b)(i) above, and so long as such player is in compliance with his in-patient or aftercare obligations under the Program (as determined by the Medical Director), he shall receive from his Team a reasonable and necessary living expense stipend to be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association which (A) shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the Salary that the player would otherwise have been entitled to earn for the period of his dismissal and disqualification and (B) shall not be payable for more than one (1) year from the date of such dismissal and disqualification.
    (iii) Any First-Year Player who tests positive for marijuana or a SPED pursuant to this Section 6, shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may be. Any First-Year Player who tests positive for a Diuretic pursuant to this Section 6, shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 below.
(c) In the event that a Veteran Player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse pursuant to this Section 6, he shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below. If the player tests positive for marijuana or a SPED pursuant to this Section 6, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic pursuant to this Section 6, he shall enter the SPED Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 below.
(d) In the event that any player tests "positive" pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above in connection with testing conducted pursuant to this Section 6, that positive test result shall be considered a positive test result for a Drug of Abuse, and the player shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below.

    (i) Any player who, after entering Stage 1 or Stage 2 of the Drugs of Abuse Program, fails to comply with his treatment or his aftercare program as prescribed and determined by the Medical Director, shall be suspended. Such suspension shall continue until the player has, in the professional judgment of the Medical Director, resumed full compliance with his treatment program.
    (ii) Notwithstanding Section 10(a) above, any player who in the professional judgment of the Medical Director, after entering Stage 1 or Stage 2 of the Drugs of Abuse Program, fails to comply with his treatment program through (A) a pattern of behavior that demonstrates a mindful disregard for his treatment responsibilities, or (B) a positive test for a Prohibited Substance other than a SPED that is not clinically expected by the Medical Director, shall suffer the following penalties:
          (1) if the player is in Stage 1 of the Drugs of Abuse Program, he shall advance to Stage 2 and be suspended until, in the professional judgment of the Medical Director, he has resumed full compliance with his treatment program; or
          (2) if the player already is in Stage 2 of the Drugs of Abuse Program, he shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below.
(b) <U>**Marijuana.**</U>
    (i) Any player who, after entering the Marijuana Program, fails to comply (without a reasonable excuse) with his treatment program as prescribed and determined by the Medical Director, shall be fined \$5,000 for each day that he fails to comply. Such fines shall continue until the player has, in the professional judgment of the Medical Director, resumed full compliance with his treatment program. The total amount of such fines shall not exceed the player's total Compensation.
    (ii) Notwithstanding Section 10(b)(i) above, any player who, after entering the Marijuana Program, fails to comply with his treatment program as prescribed and determined by the Medical Director through (A) a pattern of behavior that demonstrates a mindful disregard for his treatment responsibilities, or (B) a positive test for marijuana that is not clinically expected by the Medical Director, shall suffer the following penalties:
          (1) if the player has not previously been fined \$25,000 under Section 8(c) above or this Section 10(b)(ii), a fine of \$25,000;
          (2) if the player has previously been fined \$25,000 under Section 8(c) above or this Section 10(b)(ii), a suspension of five (5) games; or
          (3) if the player has previously been suspended for five (5) or more games under Section 8(c) above or this Section 10(b)(ii), a suspension that is at least five (5) games longer than his immediately-preceding suspension and that shall continue until, in the professional judgment of the Medical Director, the player resumes full compliance with his treatment program.
    (iii) In addition to any consequence to the player under Section 10(b)(ii) above, any player who has entered the Marijuana Program but not the Drugs of Abuse Program, and tests positive for a Drug of Abuse in any test conducted by the Medical Director, shall enter Stage 1 of the Drugs of Abuse Program.
(c) <U>**SPEDs.**</U>
    (i) Any player who, after entering the SPED Program, fails to comply (without a reasonable excuse) with his treatment program as prescribed and determined by the Medical Director, shall be fined \$5,000 per day for each day that he fails to comply.

          (2) if the player has previously been suspended for twenty (20) games under Section 9(c) above or this Section 10(c)(ii), a suspension of forty-five (45) games; or
          (3) if the player has been previously suspended for forty- five (45) games under Section 9(c) above or this Section 10(c)(ii), the player shall be immediately dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below.

If any test conducted pursuant to this Section 10(d) is positive: (x) for a Drug of Abuse or pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above (for a player in the Drugs of Abuse Program), then the player shall suffer the applicable consequence set forth in Section 10(a)(ii) above; (y) for marijuana or pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above (for a player in the Marijuana Program), then the player shall suffer the applicable consequence set forth in Section 10(b)(ii) above; or (z) for a SPED or pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above (for a player in the SPED Program), then the player will suffer the applicable consequence set forth in Section 10(c)(ii) above. If any test conducted pursuant to this Section 10(d) is positive for a Diuretic, then the player shall suffer the applicable consequences of a positive test for the Prohibited Substance for which he entered the Program.

## Dismissal and Disqualification.

(a) A player who, under the terms of this Agreement, is "dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a)" shall, without exception, immediately be so dismissed and disqualified for a period of not less than two (2) years, and such player's Player Contract shall be rendered null and void and of no further force or effect (subject to the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Uniform Player Contract). Such dismissal and disqualification shall be mandatory and may not be rescinded or reduced by the player's Team or the NBA.
(b) In addition to any other provision of this Agreement requiring that a player be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) above, a player will also be dismissed and disqualified under Section 11(a) above if he is convicted of (including a plea of guilty, no contest, or nolo contendere to) a crime involving the use, possession or distribution of a Prohibited Substance other than marijuana or a felony involving the distribution of marijuana.

## Reinstatement.

(a) After a period of at least two (2) years from the time of a player's dismissal and disqualification under Section 11(a) above, and after a period of at least one (1) year from the date of a First-Year Player's dismissal and disqualification under Section 6(b) above, such player may apply for reinstatement as a player in the NBA. However, such player shall have no right to reinstatement under any circumstance and the reinstatement shall be granted only with the prior approval of both the NBA and the Players Association, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The approval of the NBA and the Players Association shall rest in their absolute and sole discretion, and their decision shall be final, binding, and unappealable. Among the factors that may be considered by the NBA and the Players Association in determining whether to grant reinstatement are (without limitation): the circumstances surrounding the player's dismissal and disqualification; whether the player has satisfactorily completed a treatment and rehabilitation program; the player's conduct since his dismissal, including the extent to which the player has since comported himself as a suitable role model for youth; and whether the player is judged to possess the requisite qualities of good character and morality.
(b) For a First-Year Player, the NBA and the Players Association will consider an application for reinstatement only if the player has, in the opinion of the Medical Director, successfully completed any in-patient treatment and/or aftercare prescribed by the Medical Director. For a Veteran Player, the NBA and the Players Association will consider any application for reinstatement only if the player can demonstrate, by proof of random urine testing acceptable to the Medical Director (conducted on at least a weekly basis), that he has not tested positive (i) for a Prohibited Substance within the twelve (12) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed, and (ii) if the Medical Director deems it necessary in his or her professional judgment, for alcohol for the six (6) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed.
(c) The granting of an application for reinstatement may be conditioned upon random testing of the player or such other terms as may be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association, whether or not such terms are contemplated by the terms of this Article XXXIII.
(d) Any player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 and is subsequently dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) above shall therefore be ineligible for reinstatement pursuant to this Section 12.
(e) In the event that the application for reinstatement of a First-Year Player dismissed and disqualified pursuant to Section 6(b) above is approved, such player, by reason of his Player Contract having been rendered null and void pursuant to Section 6(b) above, shall be deemed not to have completed his Player Contract by rendering the playing services called for thereunder. Accordingly, such player shall not be a Free Agent and shall not be entitled to negotiate or sign a Player Contract with any NBA Team, except as specifically provided in this Section 12.
(f) (i) A First-Year Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement, notify the Team to which he was under contract at the time of his dismissal and disqualification (the "previous Team"). Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Section 12(f)(ii) below, the previous Team shall then have thirty (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with a stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the event that the Tender is made during a Season, of at least the remainder of that Season) and calling for at least the Minimum Player Salary then applicable to that player but not more than the Salary provided for in Section 12(f)(ii)below. If the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player Contract with the previous Team within the year following such Tender, the player shall thereupon be deemed a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First Refusal. If the previous Team fails to make a Tender, the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.
    (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12(f)(i) above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves the notice required by Section 12(f)(i), he is under contract to a professional basketball team not in the NBA, or (B) the player signs a contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA at any point after the date on which the player serves the notice required by Section 12(f)(i) and before the date on which the previous Team makes a Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team that he is immediately available to sign and begin rendering playing services under a Player Contract with such Team, provided that such notice will not be effective until the player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign with and begin rendering playing services for such team.
    (iii) A First-Year Player who is reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 may enter into a Player Contract with his previous Team that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the Player's Salary and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he was dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the previous Team enter into such Player Contract and such Contract covers more than one Season, increases and decreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(c)(1); provided, however, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed and disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale Contract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the player's new Contract may not exceed two (2) Seasons plus two (2) Option Years in favor of the Team, and the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for in any Season of the player's new Contract, including any Option Year, may not exceed the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for during the corresponding Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract contains terms identical to those contained in the remaining Seasons of the Player's Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Team exercises all Option Year(s) available under the new Contract, then the player's Team shall retain the same rights with respect to such new Contract as it would have retained under Article XI following the completion of the player's Rookie Scale Contract.
(g) (i) A Veteran Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement, notify the Team to which he was under contract at the time of his dismissal and disqualification (the "previous Team"). Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Section 12(g)(ii) below, the previous Team shall then have thirty (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with a stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the event the Tender is made during a Season, of at least the rest of that Season) and calling for a Salary in the first Season covered by the Tender at least equal to the lesser of (A) the player's Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which he was dismissed and disqualified, or (B) the Estimated Average Player Salary during the then-current Season, in either case reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season covered by the Tender is a partial Season, but not greater than the Salary provided in Section 12(g)(iii) below. If the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player Contract with the previous Team within the year following such Tender, then the player shall thereupon be deemed a Restricted or an Unrestricted Free Agent, in accordance with the provisions of Article XI. If the previous Team fails to make a Required Tender, the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.
    (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12(g)(i) above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves the notice required by Section 12(g)(i), he is under contract to a professional basketball team not in the NBA, or (B) the player signs a contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA at any point after the date on which he serves the notice required by Section 12(g)(i) and before the date on which the previous Team makes a Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team that he is available to sign a Player Contract with and begin rendering playing services for such Team immediately, provided that such notice will not be effective until the player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign with and begin rendering playing services for such Team.
    (iii) A Veteran Player who is reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 may enter into a Player Contract with his previous Team that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the player's Salary and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he was dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the previous Team enter into such Player Contract and such Contract covers more than one (1) Season, increases and decreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(c)(i); provided, however, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed and disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale Contract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the Player's new Contract may not exceed the number of Seasons (including the Option Year in favor of the Team) that remained under the player's Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Salary called for in any Season of the Player's new Contract (including any Option Year), may not exceed the Salary called for during the corresponding Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract contains terms identical to those contained in the remaining Seasons of the player's Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the player's Team ultimately exercises the Option Year available under the new Contract, then such Team shall retain the same rights with respect to such new Contract as it would have retained under Article XI following the completion of the player's Rookie Scale Contract.

## Exclusivity of the Program.

(a) Except as expressly provided in this Article XXXIII, there shall be no other screening or testing for Prohibited Substances conducted by the NBA or any Team, and no player may undergo such screening or testing; provided, however, that, in a medical emergency, team physicians may test players solely for diagnostic purposes in order to provide satisfactory medical care. The results of any diagnostic drug testing conducted pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be used for any other purpose by the player's Team or the NBA. If any Team is found to have tested a player in violation of this Section 13, the NBA will impose a substantial fine not to exceed \$750,000 upon such Team pursuant to the NBA's Constitution and By-Laws.
(b) The penalties set forth in this Article XXXIII shall be the exclusive penalties to be imposed upon a player for the use, possession or distribution of a Prohibited Substance.
(c) No Uniform Player Contract entered into after the date hereof shall include any term or provision that modifies, contradicts, changes, or is inconsistent with paragraph 8 of such Contract (including any condition or limitation on salary protection, as precluded by Article II, Section 4(l)) or provides for the testing of a player for illegal substances. Any term or provision of a currently effective Uniform Player Contract that is inconsistent with paragraph 8 of such Contract shall be deemed null and void only to the extent of the inconsistency.

## HGH Blood Testing.

(a) The NBA and the Players Association shall, no later than March 15, 2012, appoint an HGH Testing Panel (the "HGH Panel"), which shall be comprised of three (3) individuals who shall be experts in the field of testing for performance-enhancing substances. If the NBA and the Players Association are unable to agree on the members of the HGH Panel by the date specified, each shall appoint one (1) expert to the HGH Panel by April 1, 2012, and these two (2) experts shall, by April 15, 2012, appoint the third expert member of the HGH Panel.
(b) The purpose of the HGH Panel is to determine whether, in its judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players and, if so, to determine the laboratory testing protocols and specimen collection procedures to be implemented in connection with such test. The Panel may use such methods and collect such information as, in its judgment, are necessary and appropriate to make these determinations, and the NBA, the Players Association, NBA Teams, and NBA players shall cooperate fully in this process -- including, with respect to players, by permitting any anonymous baseline testing (by blood testing or otherwise) that the HGH Panel may determine, in its judgment, is necessary and appropriate. (Any such testing shall not result in any penalty for any player.)
(c) By July 1, 2012, the HGH Panel shall issue a written report to the NBA and the Players Association setting forth its determination as to whether, in its judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players. If the Panel determines that such test does not exist, it shall issue a written report to the parties on each succeeding July 1, setting forth its determination as to whether, in its judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may -- no more than once each year -- request in writing (with a copy to the other side) that the HGH Panel consider developments in the science relating to HGH testing and issue, within three (3) months of such request, a determination as to whether, in its judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players.
(d) If, pursuant to the foregoing, the HGH Panel determines that there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players and provides written notice to the NBA and the Players Association of the same (which shall include a description of the laboratory testing protocols and specimen collection procedures to be implemented in connection with such testing), the NBA may commence HGH Blood Testing within sixty (60) days thereafter, after notice is provided to NBA players. Such testing may take place under Section 5 (Reasonable Cause Testing), Section 6 (Random Testing) and Section 9 (Steroids, Performance-Enhancing Drugs and Masking Agents) above, and Section 15 (Additional Bases for Testing) below; provided, however, that random HGH Blood Testing pursuant to Section 6 above will occur no more than two (2) times during each Season and no more than one (1) time during each Off-Season. (For clarity, the number of random blood tests for Human Growth Hormone shall be in addition to the number of random urine tests for other Prohibited Substances called for in Section 6 above.) Random HGH blood tests shall occur at the same time that players undergo random urine tests for other SPEDs.

## Additional Bases for Testing.

(a) Any player who seeks treatment outside the Program for a problem involving a Prohibited Substance shall, as directed by the NBA (after notice to the Players Association), submit himself to an evaluation by the Medical Director and provide (or cause to be provided) to the Medical Director such medical and treatment records as the Medical Director may request. The Medical Director may, in his or her professional judgment, also require such a player, without prior notice, to submit to testing for Prohibited Substances, provided that the frequency of such testing shall not exceed three (3) times per week and the duration of such testing shall not exceed one (1) year from the date of the player's initial evaluation by the Medical Director.
(b) Any player who is subject to in-patient or aftercare treatment in the Program and is formally charged with "driving while intoxicated," "driving under the influence of alcohol," or any other crime or offense involving suspected alcohol or illegal substance use shall, provided that the NBA has advised the Players Association, be required to submit to a urine test, to be conducted by the NBA, within seven (7) days of being so charged.
(c) If, pursuant to Section 15(a) above, a player (i) tests positive for a Drug of Abuse; (ii) tests positive pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above; or (iii) refuses or fails to submit to an evaluation or provide (or cause to be provided) the information requested by the Medical Director, but does not Come Forward Voluntarily within sixty (60) days of being requested to do so by the NBA (with notice to the Players Association), or if, pursuant to Section 15(b) above, a player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse, then, in either case the player shall advance two stages in the Drugs of Abuse Program—i.e., the player shall enter Stage 2 of the Drugs of Abuse Program (if the player had not previously entered Stage 1 of such Program), and the player shall be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) above (if the player had previously entered Stage 1 or Stage 2 of such Program).
(d) If, pursuant to Section 15(a) or (b) above, a player tests positive for marijuana or a SPED, he shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 above, as the case may be. If, pursuant to Section 15(a) or (b) above, a player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 above.
(e) If a player is or, within the previous six (6) months, (i) has been in possession of any device or product used or designed for substituting, diluting, or adulterating a specimen sample, or (ii) has been subject to a finding by another sports league or anti-doping organization that he has substituted, diluted or adulterated a specimen sample and that finding has not been overturned on appeal, that player shall be required to undergo testing for Prohibited Substances no more than four (4) times during the six-week period following his notification by the NBA of the commencement of such testing. If the player (i) tests positive for a Drug of Abuse or (ii) tests positive pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above, he shall be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) above. If the player tests positive for marijuana or a SPED, he shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 above, as the case may be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9, above.
(f) Nothing in this Section 15 shall limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions of Section 5 (Reasonable Cause Testing).

## Additional Prohibited Substances.

(a) Any steroid or performance-enhancing drug that is declared illegal during the term of this Agreement will automatically be added to the list of Prohibited Substances as a SPED.
(b) At any time during the term of this Agreement, either the NBA or the Players Association may convene a meeting of the Prohibited Substances Committee to request that a substance or substances be added to the list of Prohibited Substances set forth on Exhibit I-2 to this Agreement. Any such addition of a Prohibited Substance may only include a substance that is or is reasonably likely to be physically harmful to Players and is or is reasonably likely to be improperly performance-enhancing. The determination of the Committee to add to the list of Prohibited Substances shall be made by a majority vote of all five (5) Committee members, and shall be final, binding, and unappealable.
(c) Players will receive notice of any addition to the list of Prohibited Substances six (6) months prior to the date on which such addition becomes effective under this Article XXXIII.
