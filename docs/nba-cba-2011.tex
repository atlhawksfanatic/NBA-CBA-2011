\emph{If you are only interested in a pdf or epub of the CBA, then please click on the download icon at the top left (it is next to the ``A'') and select the format you wish to download.}

This is the 2011 NBA's Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) converted to markdown and disseminated in the format you are currently viewing this as.

The original version of the 2011 CBA can be found on my Github website \href{https://atlhawksfanatic.github.io/}{atlhawksfanatic.github.io} (\href{https://github.com/atlhawksfanatic/atlhawksfanatic.github.io/raw/master/research/CBA/2011-NBA-NBPA-Collective-Bargaining-Agreement.pdf}{pdf found here}) as a way to cross-reference any potential discrepancies.

The original CBA was converted to a text file with \href{https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools}{pdftools}, then broken up by Article and Exhibit through regular expressions into .Rmd files. Those .Rmd files serves as the basis for this bookdown site.

The purpose of this project is three-fold:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  to historically document collective bargaining agreements of the NBA;
\item
  to provide easier navigation of the CBA through a structured format of each Article and Section; and
\item
  for me to better understand the CBA through this exercise.
\end{enumerate}

I do not own any rights to the CBA and am simply redistributing it in a different format. This is not the official version of the CBA and I am not responsible for any errors that might be present in this document. If you believe you have found an error, please let me know and I will correct it.

\item
  \textbf{Basketball-Related Injury.} When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to paragraph 16(a)(iv) thereof, by reason of the player's failure to render his services thereunder, if such failure has been caused by the player's disability and/or unfitness to play skilled basketball as a direct result of an injury sustained while participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or limitations set forth in this Section 4(c), Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract, or expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 7(b), 7(c), 16(a)(iii), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d), and 16(g) of such Contract, the termination of such Contract by the Team shall in no way affect the player's right to receive, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 to such Contract in the amounts and at the times called for by such Exhibit; provided, however, that: (i) such injury does not result from an attempted suicide, the abuse of alcohol, or the use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled substance; (ii) at the time of the player's termination, the player is not in material breach of such Contract; (iii) if the Team, for its own benefit, seeks to procure an insurance policy covering the player's injury, the player cooperates with the Team in procuring such an insurance policy, including by, among other things, supplying all information requested of him, completing application forms, or otherwise and submitting to all examinations and tests requested of him by or on behalf of the insurance company in connection with the Team's efforts to procure such policy; and (iv) if the Team, for its own benefit, has procured such an insurance policy, the player cooperates (in the manner described above) with the Team and the insurance company in the processing of the Team's claim under such policy.
\item
  \textbf{Injury or Illness.} When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract in the event such contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to paragraph 16(a)(iv) thereof, by reason of the player's failure to render his services thereunder, if such failure has been caused by an injury, illness, or disability suffered or sustained by the player, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or limitations set forth in this Section 4(d), Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract, or expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 7(b), 7(c), 16(a)(iii), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d), and 16(g) of such Contract, the termination of such Contract by the Team shall in no way affect the player's right to receive, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 to such Contract in the amounts and at the times called for by such Exhibit; provided, however, that: (i) such injury, illness, or disability does not result from the player's participation in activities prohibited by paragraph 12 of the Uniform Player Contract (as such paragraph may be modified in Exhibit 5 to the Player Contract), attempted suicide, the abuse of alcohol, or the use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled substance; (ii) at the time of such injury, illness, or disability the player is not in material breach of such Contract; (iii) if the Team, for its own benefit, seeks to procure an insurance policy covering the player's injury and/or illness, the player cooperates with the Team in procuring such an insurance policy, including by, among other things, supplying all information requested of him, completing application forms, or otherwise and submitting to all examinations and tests requested of him by or on behalf of the insurance company in connection with the Team's efforts to procure such policy; and (iv) if the Team, for its own benefit, has procured such an insurance policy, the player cooperates (in the manner described above) with the Team and insurance company in the processing of the Team's claim under such policy.
\item
  \textbf{Mental Disability.} When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to paragraph 16(a)(iv) thereof, by reason of the player's failure to render his services thereunder, if such failure has been caused by the player's mental disability, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or limitations set forth in this Section 4(e), Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract, or expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 16(a)(iii), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d), 16(e), and 16(g) of such Contract, the termination of such Contract by the Team shall in no way affect the player's (or his duly appointed legal representative's) right to receive, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 to such Contract in the amounts and at the times called for by such Exhibit; provided, however, that: (i) such mental disability does not result from the player's attempted suicide, or the use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled substance; (ii) at the time of the player's failure to render playing services, the player is not in material breach of such Contract; (iii) if the Team, for its own benefit, seeks to procure an insurance policy covering the player's mental disability, the player (and/or his duly appointed legal representative) cooperates with the Team in procuring such an insurance policy, including by, among other things, supplying all information requested of him, completing application forms, or otherwise and submitting to all examinations and tests requested of him by the insurance company in connection with the Team's efforts to procure such policy; and (iv) if the Team, for its own benefit, has procured such an insurance policy, the player (and/or his duly appointed legal representative) cooperates (in the manner described above) with the Team and insurance company in the processing of the Team's claim under such policy.
\item
  No agreement by a Team to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract shall require (or be construed as requiring) such Team to continue to employ the player (whether on the Active List, Inactive List, or otherwise); nor shall any such agreement afford the player any right to be employed, or to be deemed as having been employed, by such Team for any purpose.
\item
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract, and such protection is contingent on the satisfaction of a condition expressly set forth in Exhibit 2 to that Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective only if the Player Contract has not previously been terminated at the time such condition is satisfied.
\item
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for in any Option Year in favor of the Team included in a Uniform Player Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective only if the option to extend the term provided for in the Contract was exercised by the Team prior to the termination of the Contract. When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for in any Option Year in favor of the player, the applicability of such protection in the circumstance where the Option has not been exercised by the player shall be governed by the provisions of Article XII, Section 2(a).
\item
  During the term of a Player Contract, the percentage of protected Base Compensation for any future Season shall not exceed the percentage of unearned protected Base Compensation for any prior Season. Thus, for example, a Team could not provide for fifty percent (50\%) Base Compensation protection in the first Season of a Player Contract and one hundred percent (100\%) Base Compensation protection in the second Season of the Contract. However, the foregoing rule does not prevent a Team from providing a percentage of Base Compensation protection in a future Season that is higher than in a prior Season if the higher level of Base Compensation for the future Season is conditional and the condition cannot be satisfied until the completion of the prior Season. For example, it is permissible for a Contract to provide that Base Compensation protection for the first Season of a Player Contract equals fifty percent (50\%) and Base Compensation protection for the second Season will be increased from fifty percent (50\%) to one hundred percent (100\%) if the player is on the Team's roster as of the August 1 prior to the second
  Season of the Player Contract.
\item
  With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended on or after the date of this Agreement (other than Player Contracts that provide in any Season for the player to earn Compensation not greater than his applicable Minimum Player Salary):

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\roman{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The maximum amount of aggregate Base Compensation that can be protected for death is thirty million dollars (\$30,000,000).
  \item
    If a player elects to purchase term life insurance for his benefit, his Team shall be permitted to reimburse him each Season for the premiums paid for such insurance with respect to such Season and any other future Season(s); provided, however, that (A) the amount of coverage for which premiums are reimbursed by the Team in any Season shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount of the player's unearned Base Compensation for such Season and each remaining Season (excluding an Option Year if not yet exercised) that is not protected for death, and (y) forty million dollars (\$40,000,000) and (B) any such premium reimbursement shall not exceed the cost for 10-year guaranteed term coverage at preferred rates.
  \item
    If a Contract contains death protection covering ten million dollars (\$10,000,000) or more of Base Compensation, the player shall be precluded from purchasing life insurance for a period of ninety (90) days following the execution of the Contract or until such earlier time as the Team notifies the player in writing that it is no longer attempting to purchase life insurance coverage on the player (up to the amount of the player's Base Compensation protection for death) for the Team's benefit. During such ninety (90) day period or until such time as the Team issues the foregoing written notification to the player, the Team's efforts to purchase life insurance on the player for the Team's benefit shall be conducted diligently and in good faith.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended on or after the date of this Agreement, in the event that a Team terminates such a Player Contract (resulting in the player's separation of service from the Team), and the Team is obligated thereafter to make payments to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract, such payments shall be rescheduled as follows: (i) if the request for waivers on the player is made during the period from September 1 through the following June 30, then (x) the Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract with respect to the Salary Cap Year in which the request for waivers is made shall be paid in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in the Contract; and (y) the remaining Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract shall be aggregated and paid in equal amounts per Season over a period equal to twice the number of Seasons (including any Player Option Year) remaining on the Contract following the Salary Cap Year in which the request for waivers occurred (not including the then-current Season (or, in the case of requests for waivers made from September 1 through the first day of a Regular Season, the upcoming Season)), plus one Season; and (ii) if the request for waivers on the player is made during the period from July 1 through August 31, then the remaining Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract shall be aggregated and paid in equal amounts per Season over a period equal to twice the number of Seasons (including any Player Option Year) remaining on the Contract following the date of the waiver (including the upcoming Season), plus one Season. With respect to Player Contracts extended on or after the date of this Agreement, the foregoing payment rescheduling shall apply only with respect to the extended term of the Player Contract. In all circumstances described above except where specifically noted otherwise, the Base Compensation in each Season shall be paid in accordance with the schedule set forth in paragraph 3 of the Contract. (The following example is for clarity. A player has four Seasons remaining on his Contract with protected Base Compensation of the following amounts: \$4 million in Season 1, \$4.3 million in Season 2, \$4.7 million in Season 3, and \$5 million in Season 4. The player is waived on December 1 of Season 1. Under Section 4(k)(i)(x) above, the player would receive the remainder of his \$4 million in Base Compensation for Season 1 in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in his Contract. Under Section 4(k)(i)(y) above, the \$14 million of protected Base Compensation remaining to be paid for Seasons 2 - 4 of the Contract would be paid at a rate of \$2 million per Season for the next seven (7) Seasons in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in paragraph 3 of the Contract. If the same player is instead waived on July 30 of Season 1, the \$18 million of protected Base Compensation remaining to be paid for Seasons 1 - 4 of the Contract would be paid -- under Section 4(k)(ii) above -- at a rate of \$2 million per Season for the next nine (9) Seasons in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in paragraph 3 of the Contract.)
\item
  Notwithstanding that a Team and a player are authorized under Article II, Section 4(a)-(e) to negotiate additional conditions or limitations applicable to the player's Compensation protection for such categories as the Team and player agree to protect, no Player Contract entered into on or after the date of this Agreement may contain an additional condition or limitation relating to the player's use, possession, or distribution of any substance covered under the NBA Anti-Drug Program set forth in Article XXXIII.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\roman{enumii})}

  \item
    for any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years of Service, the greater of (x) twenty-five percent (25\%) of the Salary Cap in effect on the day following the last day of the Moratorium Period, or (y) one hundred five percent (105\%) of the Salary provided for in the final Season of the original term of the Contract; provided, however, that a 5th Year Eligible Player who signed a Rookie Scale Extension and has met at least one of the 5th Year 30\% Max Criteria shall be eligible to receive from his Prior Team up to thirty percent (30\%) of the Salary Cap in effect on the day following the last day of the Moratorium Period;

  \end{enumerate}

  then such Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses shall immediately be deemed amended to provide for the maximum amount allowed by the applicable subsection (c)(i), (c)(ii), or (c)(iii) set forth above. In such circumstance, Salaries plus Unlikely Bonuses in subsequent Seasons of the extended term shall also immediately be deemed amended to provide for increases or decreases over the amended Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the first Season of the extended term in accordance with Article VII, Section 5(c).
\item
  A player and a Team may provide in a Rookie Scale Extension that the player's Salary (in the first Season of the extended term) will equal ``the Maximum Annual Salary applicable to such player in the first Season of the extended term'' or:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\roman{enumii})}

  \item
    in the case of a Rookie Scale Extension for a First Round Pick who at the time the Extension is signed has already met at least one of the 5th Year 30\% Max Criteria, the player and Team may instead provide in the Extension that the player's Salary (in the first Season of the extended term) will equal ``{[}\_\_\_\_\_{]}\% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season of the extended term.'' The percentage to be included where brackets are indicated in the foregoing language shall equal the percentage that is agreed upon by the Team and player, which percentage shall in no event be less than twenty-five percent (25\%) or greater than thirty percent (30\%); or
  \item
    in the case of a Rookie Scale Extension for any other First Round Pick (i.e., a First Round Pick who did not meet any of the 5th Year 30\% Max Criteria during the first three (3) Seasons of his Rookie Scale Contract), the Team may instead provide in the Extension that the player's Salary (in the first Season of the extended term) will equal ``25\% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season of the extended term, or, if the player meets at least one of the 5th Year 30\% Max Criteria during the fourth Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, {[}\_\_{]}\% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season of the extended term.'' The percentage to be included where brackets are indicated in the foregoing language shall equal the percentage that is agreed upon by the Team and player, which percentage shall in no event be less than twenty-five percent (25\%) or greater than thirty percent (30\%).
  \end{enumerate}

  The player and Team may provide in a Rookie Scale Extension that the Salaries in any Seasons after the first Season of the extended term will be increased or decreased based on percentages specified by the parties that comply with Article VII, Section 5(c). In the case of a Rookie Scale Extension entered into pursuant to (ii) above, the player and Team may instead provide that Salaries in any Seasons after the first Season of the extended term will be increased or decreased by a different percentage based on the percentage of the Salary Cap that the player receives in Salary in the first Season of the extended term. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, a Designated Player Rookie Salary Scale Extension must provide for annual increases in Salary for each Season following the first Season of the extended term equal to seven and one-half percent (7.5\%) of Salary for the Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term. Any such Rookie Scale Extension (including any such Designated Player Rookie Scale Extension) shall be deemed amended onthe day following the last day of the Moratorium Period of the Salary Cap Year covering the first Season of the extended term to provide for specific Salaries for each Season of the extended term, based on the Maximum Annual Salary applicable to such player on the day following the last day of the Moratorium Period. A Rookie Scale Extension entered into pursuant to this subsection may not include any Incentive Compensation.
\item
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a trade of a Uniform Player Contract would, by reason of a trade bonus contained in such Contract, cause the player's Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the Salary Cap Year in which such trade occurs to exceed the following amounts:

    for any player who has at least seven (7) but fewer than ten (10) Years of Service, the greater of (x) thirty percent (30\%) of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the trade bonus is earned, or (y) one hundred five percent (105\%) of the player's Salary for the Season prior to the Season in which the trade bonus is earned; or
  \item
    for any player who has completed ten (10) or more Years of Service, the greater of (x) thirty-five percent (35\%) of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the trade bonus is earned, or (y) one hundred five percent (105\%) of the player's Salary for the Season prior to the Season in which the trade bonus is earned;
  \end{enumerate}

  then such player's trade bonus shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to reduce the player's Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses to the maximum amount allowed by the applicable subsection (e)(i), (e)(ii), or (e)(iii) set forth above.
\item
  For purposes of this Section 7 only, the Salary Cap shall be calculated in accordance with Article VII, Section 2, except that the percentage of Projected BRI to be utilized for such calculation shall be forty-two and fourteen one hundredths percent (42.14\%) for all Salary Cap Years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Salary Cap for the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year for purposes of this Section 7 only will be \$51.689 million, and (ii) the Salary Cap for the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year for purposes of this Section 7 only will equal the greater of (x) the Salary Cap as calculated pursuant to this Section 7(f), and (y) \$54.675 million.
\item
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Contract or Rookie Scale Extension entered into between a 5th Year Eligible Player and a Team that provides for Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the first Season covered by the Contract or Rookie Scale Extension greater than twenty-five percent (25\%) of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season of the Contract or extended term (as applicable) in accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 7 must be for at least four (4) Seasons (excluding any Option Year) and, in the case of a Rookie Scale Extension, excluding the last Season covered by the player's Rookie Scale Contract.

For example, if a Team has thirteen (13) players on its Active List and no players on its Inactive List, then the Team may have one player under a 10-Day Contract. If a Team has thirteen (13) players on its Active List and two (2) players on its Inactive List, then the team may have three (3) players under a 10-Day Contract.

\item
  No Team shall make any direct or indirect payment of any money, property, investments, loans, or anything else of value for fees or otherwise to an agent, attorney, or representative of a player (for or in connection with such person's representation of such player); nor shall any Player Contract provide for such payment.

The determination of whether the player has passed the physical examination shall be made by the Team in its sole discretion. If the player does not pass the physical examination, the Team shall so notify the player no later than the sixth business day following the execution of the Contract.
  \item
    The Team's determination that the player has passed the physical examination by the player shall be a condition precedent to the validity of the Contract. Accordingly, and without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, until such time as a player has passed the physical examination, the prohibitions set forth in Section 12(b) above shall continue to apply to the Team and player.
  \item
    A Required Tender or a Qualifying Offer may contain an Exhibit 6. If a player accepts such a Required Tender or Qualifying Offer but does not pass the required physical examination, the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer shall be deemed to have been withdrawn, which shall have the consequences described in Article X, Section 4 or Article XI, Section 4, as the case may be.

\item
  \textbf{Moving Expenses.} A Team's obligation to reimburse a player for ``reasonable'' expenses related to the assignment of a Player Contract from one Team to another (in accordance with paragraph 10 of a Uniform Player Contract) shall extend to the reimbursement of the actual expenses incurred by such player in moving to the home territory of his new Team, provided that such expenses result directly from the assignment and are ordinary and reasonable, and provided further that, prior to his actually incurring such expenses, the player (i) consults with the Team to which his Contract has been assigned in advance concerning his move, and (ii) furnishes the Team with a written estimate of such proposed expenses from an established moving company so as to afford such assignee-Team an opportunity to make reasonably comparable alternative arrangements for the move of the player. The player shall furnish such written estimate to the Team within a reasonable time following the notice of the assignment of the Player Contract. Upon receipt of such estimate from the player, the Team shall, within ten (10) days, either agree to reimburse the player for the expenses set forth in such estimate or make alternative arrangements (at the Team's expense) for the move of the player. ``Reasonable'' moving expenses shall include the cost of moving not more than one (1) automobile for the player (and not more than two (2) automobiles if the player is married).
\item
  \textbf{Hotel Accommodations.} A player whose Contract is assigned from one Team to another shall be reimbursed by the assignee-Team for the cost of a hotel room in a hotel (comparable to that in which such Team's players are lodged while ``on the road'') in the assignee-Team's home city for up to forty-six (46) days following the assignment.
\item
  \textbf{Housing Costs Reimbursement.} A player whose Contract is assigned from one Team to another shall be reimbursed by the assignee-Team for the cost of his living quarters (either rent or mortgage expense) in the city from which he is assigned, for a period of three months after the date of the assignment; provided, however, that such payment shall be made only if and to the extent that the player is legally obligated for such costs, and shall not exceed \$4,500 per month. Any such payments shall be made on a pro rata basis if a full month is not involved.
\item
  \textbf{Proof of Expenses.} Prior to reimbursing an assigned player as provided in this Section, an assignee-Team may require satisfactory proof that the player has paid the amounts for which he seeks reimbursement, and, in the case of housing costs reimbursements, satisfactory proof that the player is legally obligated to pay such housing costs and the amount thereof. Upon notice to the player, the assignee-Team may, as an alternative to reimbursement, pay the expenses incurred upon assignment (in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section) directly to the persons, firms, or corporations involved.
\item
  \textbf{Player Obligation to Minimize Potential Liability.} So as to minimize the potential liability of NBA Teams under this Section, a player who does not establish permanent or year-round residence in the home city (or geographic vicinity thereof) of the Team by which he is employed shall use his best efforts (i) to obtain a short-term lease on the living quarters he selects, and (ii) to procure lease provisions authorizing him to sublet such premises and/or granting such Team the option to take over such lease in the event the Contract of such player is assigned to another NBA Team.

Effective with the date of this Agreement, and continuing until the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the National Basketball Association Players' Pension Plan, as restated effective February 2, 2009, and as amended by the First, Second, Third and Fourth Amendments thereto (the ``Pension Plan''), shall be continued and maintained in full force and effect. All capitalized terms used in this Section 1 not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Pension
Plan.

Subject to approval by the Internal Revenue Services (the ``IRS'') and to the extent permitted by applicable law, and except as provided in Section 1(f) below, the NBA shall provide the following pension benefits to NBA players and former NBA players:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Current Benefit.} As of the date of this Agreement, the Normal Retirement Pension payable under Section 3.2 of the Pension Plan shall be \$518.92 per month for each year of Credited Service payable in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Plan.
\item
  \textbf{Benefit Increases.} Effective for the Plan Year commencing February 2, 2012 and for each subsequent Plan Year beginning during the term of this Agreement, the Normal Retirement Pension payable under Section 3.2 of the Pension Plan shall be adjusted (the monthly benefit amount following any such adjustment, the ``New Monthly Benefit''), subject to Section 1(c) below, such that the New Monthly Benefit is equal to the amount that results in the actuarially-determined annual contributions to be made to the Pension Plan to fund for such New Monthly Benefit for the applicable Plan Year to equal the sum of (i) the actuarially-determined annual contributions to be made to the Pension Plan to fund the ``Baseline Benefit'' (defined below) for such Plan Year and (ii) \$10 million; provided, however, that in no event shall the New Monthly Benefit for any Plan Year be less than the New Monthly Benefit in effect for the immediately preceding Plan Year (for purposes of the foregoing, the ``New Monthly Benefit'' as of the date of this Agreement is \$518.92). The ``Baseline Benefit'' means the Normal Retirement Pension amount in effect under the Pension Plan prior to the additions of the benefit increase amounts set forth in Sections 3.2(z) and 3.2A of the Pension Plan, as adjusted for future increases in the cost-of-living in the manner provided for in Section 415(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code'').

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Any increase in the New Monthly Benefit after the date of this Agreement shall be effective as of the first day of the month following the beginning of the Plan Year of the Pension Plan to which the increase relates (the ``New Benefit Increase Commencement Date''), shall apply only to any benefit payment or payments to be made on or after the applicable New Benefit Increase Commencement Date, and shall not require the recalculation of any benefit payment or payments made prior to the applicable New Benefit Increase Commencement Date.
  \item
    The amount of any New Monthly Benefit which exceeds the Baseline Benefit (other than any death benefits payable to a beneficiary pursuant to Article VII of the Pension Plan) shall not be payable in any of the following forms of payment provided for under the Pension Plan: (i) a lump sum payment; (ii) monthly installments of a fixed amount; (iii) monthly installments for a fixed period; and (iv) monthly installments which are temporarily increased based upon the player's estimated social security benefit.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Limitations on Benefits.} Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Neither (a) the benefits accrued or payable to any player or player's beneficiary under the Pension Plan for a Plan Year nor (b) the New Monthly Benefit for a Plan Year shall exceed the maximum benefit amount permitted under the Code (and the regulations issued thereunder) as in effect for that Plan Year (as adjusted in accordance with the actuarial factors specified in the Pension Plan and as in effect on the date that the benefit accrues or commences (or is paid) or for the Plan Year for which the New Monthly Benefit is determined), as such limits may be adjusted for future increases in the cost-of-living in the manner provided under Section 415(d)(2) of the Code.
  \item
    Neither (a) the benefits accrued or payable to any player or player's beneficiary under the Pension Plan for a Plan Year nor (b) the New Monthly Benefit for a Plan Year shall exceed the maximum benefit amount permitted under the Code (and the regulations issued thereunder), as in effect for the February 2, 2010 - February 1, 2011 Plan Year, as such limits may be adjusted for future increases in the cost-of-living in the manner prescribed by Section 415(d)(2) of the Code.
  \item
    If all or any portion of the actuarially-determined annual contributions to be made to the Pension Plan would not be fully deductible under the Code when paid to the Pension Plan, the New Monthly Benefit shall not exceed the amount which would result in all of such contributions being fully deductible when paid. The Players Association shall be given written notice of any such determination.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Pre-1965 Players.} Pre-1965 Players shall continue to be entitled to receive the Normal Retirement Benefit in the amount and on the terms and conditions set forth in Article XX of the Pension Plan. Any benefits that are unable to be paid to Pre-1965 Players under the Pension Plan because of the benefit limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Code shall be paid to such Pre-1965 Players pursuant to the National Basketball Association Excess Benefit Plan for Pre-1965 Players (the ``Pre-1965 Players Excess Benefit Plan'').
\item
  \textbf{Pre-1965 Retirees.} Pre-1965 Retirees shall continue to be entitled to receive the Retirement Benefit in the amount and on the terms and conditions set forth in Article XXA of the Pension Plan.
\item
  \textbf{Players Employed by Toronto.}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \item
    Players employed by Maple Leaf Sports \& Entertainment Ltd.~(or any successor thereto) (``Toronto'') or by an NBA Team located in any other country other than the United States shall receive pension benefits of comparable value. Players employed by Toronto (``Toronto Players'') shall continue to receive such benefits by means of the Pension Plan and a separate pension plan maintained by Toronto (the ``Toronto Plan''); provided, however, that a player shall not be eligible to participate (or continue to participate) in the Pension Plan for any period of time during which the player is both a resident of Canada and a Toronto Player (a ``Canadian Resident''). Toronto shall provide an alternative arrangement to the Canadian Resident, subject to Section 1(f)(2) below.

    If the participation of Toronto Players in the Pension Plan would, at any time, result in the Pension Plan becoming subject to Canadian Provincial Pension Legislation and/or Canadian Federal Tax Laws (to the extent that the application of such tax laws would result in adverse tax consequences to the Pension Plan, the NBA Teams and/or the Toronto Players) or result in the Toronto Plan's failure, at any future time, to either be qualified under the Code or registered under Canadian Provincial Pension Legislation and/or Canadian Federal Tax Laws, then any obligation to establish, maintain and/or make contributions to the Pension Plan in respect of Toronto Players and the Toronto Plan pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players, (ii) to lockout, or (iii) to strike. In the event of such termination, Toronto shall provide an alternative arrangement to the Toronto Players, subject to Section 1(f)(2) below.
  \item
    The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon the type(s) of alternative arrangement to be provided pursuant to this Section 1(f) to either a Toronto Player or Canadian Resident. Such alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to Toronto equal to the annual accrual cost that Toronto would have incurred under the Pension Plan and the Toronto Plan.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Pension Plan Tax-Qualification Status.} Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement: (1) if any change or amendment made to the Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA''), or to any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed) or rulings issued thereunder; (2) if any interpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation, application or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder; (3) if any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed) or rulings issued by the IRS under the Code or ERISA; or (4) if any provisions of this Agreement, including any of the amendments or benefit increases to be provided under the Pension Plan pursuant to Section 1, would result in the Pension Plan no longer being a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, or would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and above any costs required to be incurred to implement the provisions of this Agreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement in order for the Pension Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the Code (provided, however, that such additional costs are incurred solely in connection with the provision of pension benefits to their non-player employees or to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation to maintain and/or make contributions to the Pension Plan pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players, (ii) to lockout, or (iii) to strike. In the event of such termination, the NBA Teams shall provide an alternative arrangement to the players. The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon the type(s) of alternative arrangement to be provided. The costs of the alternative arrangement to be provided shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams equal to the annual accrual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the Pension Plan to fund the benefit described in this Section 1, commencing on the date of termination.
\item
  \textbf{Amounts to be Applied Against New Benefit Amount.} The following amounts shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The greater of (A) Fifty (50) percent of the increase in the amount of the actuarially determined annual contributions to be made for any Plan Year to the Pension Plan to fund the difference between (1) the New Monthly Benefit for such Plan Year (\$518.92 for the Plan Year commencing February 2, 2011) over (2) the Baseline Benefit (the ``New Benefit Cost Increase'') and (B) the New Benefit Cost Increase minus \$5 million;
  \item
    Fifty (50) percent of the increase in the amount of the actuarially-determined annual contributions to be made for a Plan Year to the Pension Plan to fund the Normal Retirement Benefits for Pre-1965 Players described in Section 20.3(a)(v) of the Pension Plan over the amount of the actuarially determined annual contributions that would be required to be made for that Plan Year to the Pension Plan in order to fund the Normal Retirement Benefits for Pre-1965 Players described in Section 20.3(a)(iv) of the Pension Plan had Section 20.3(a)(v) of the Pension Plan never been in effect (the ``Pre-1965 Player Cost Increase'');
  \item
    Fifty (50) percent of the costs incurred for a Plan Year in order to provide the excess portion of the benefit amount described in Pension Plan Section 20.3(a)(v) under the Pre-1965 Players Excess Benefit Plan over the costs that would be incurred for that Plan Year in order to provide for the excess portion of the benefit amount described in Pension Plan Section 20.3(a)(iv) under the Pre-1965 Players Excess Benefit Plan had Section 20.3(a)(v) of the Pension Plan never been in effect (the ``Pre-1965 Player Excess Benefit Cost Increase'');
  \item
    Fifty (50) percent of the amount of the actuarially-determined annual contributions to be made for a Plan Year to the Pension Plan to fund the Retirement Benefits for Pre-1965 Retirees described in Section 20A.3(a) of the Pension Plan (the ``Pre-1965 Retiree Cost Increase''); and
  \item
    One hundred (100) percent of the costs, including the cost of professional fees (e.g., attorneys, accountants, actuaries and consultants) (``Professional Fees''), incurred in connection with the determination and implementation of any alternative benefits pursuant to Sections 1(f) and/or 1(g).
  \end{enumerate}

  For purposes of this Section 1(h), in determining the New Benefit Cost Increase, the Pre-1965 Player Cost Increase, the Pre-1965 Player Excess Benefit Cost Increase, and the Pre-1965 Retiree Cost Increase for a Plan Year, the annual contributions relating to such cost increases (and in the case of the Pre-1965 Player Excess Benefit Cost Increase, the costs incurred relating to such cost increase) shall be determined based on the law in effect for that Plan Year, taking into account (i) any new law or change or amendment made to ERISA, the Code and/or other applicable law, or to any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed), rulings or formal guidance issued thereunder and (ii) any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed), rulings or formal guidance issued under ERISA or the Code.
\item
  \textbf{Actuarial Determinations.}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The parties agree that, for each Plan Year, the determination of the New Monthly Benefit under Section 1(b), the determinations described in Section 1(c)(3), and the determination of the New Benefit Cost Increase, the Pre-1965 Player Cost Increase, the Pre-1965 Player Excess Benefit Cost Increase, and the Pre-1965 Retiree Cost Increase under Section 1(h) shall each be made by the actuaries of the Pension Plan, in all instances using reasonable actuarial assumptions, factors, methods and projections. Any such determinations shall be binding and conclusive.
  \item
    All relevant actuarial assumptions, factors, methods and projections used in making the determinations described in Section 1(b) shall be the same for both determining the actuarially-determined annual contributions that would have been made to the Plan for a Plan Year in order to fund for the Baseline Benefit and determining the actuarially-determined annual contributions to be made to the Pension Plan for that Plan Year in order to fund for the New Monthly Benefit.

\section{Player 401(k) Benefits.}\label{player-401k-benefits.}}

Except as set forth below in this Section 2, and subject to approval by the IRS, effective with the date of this Agreement, and continuing until the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the NBA shall provide the following 401(k) benefits to NBA players:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\item
  Benefits in accordance with the NBA-NBPA 401(k) Savings Plan as restated effective November 1, 2009, and as amended by the First and Second Amendments thereto (the ``401(k) Plan''). The 401(k) Plan shall continue to provide for (1) deferrals by players pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code and (2) except as may be limited below, Team matching contributions in respect of player deferrals for a Salary Cap Year, as requested in writing by the Players Association. The request for the matching contributions by the Players Association for a Season shall be made in writing prior to the commencement of that Season. Team matching contributions and player deferrals shall at all times be subject to all applicable limitations under the Code, including, but not limited to, the limitation on contributions under Code Section 415, the maximum limitation on compensation under Code Section 401(a)(17), and the maximum limitation on 401(k) deferrals under Code Section 402(g). The cost of funding all matching contributions made by Teams under the 401(k) Plan (i) shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, and (ii) shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(2) below. Any matching contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan in respect of each Season shall be made no later than thirty (30) days following the completion of the BRI Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year covering such Season.

  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total amount of the deferral contributions to be made by players to the 401(k) Plan and the Team matching contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan in respect of deferral contributions made by players under the 401(k) Plan shall be limited to an amount that, taking into account only compensation paid to current players by the Teams, would result in all of such deferral contributions and matching contributions being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid to the 401(k) Plan. If, for any reason, all or a portion of the deferral contributions and/or Team matching contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan will not, when paid to the 401(k) Plan, be fully deductible under the Code, the parties agree that the contributions shall be reduced to result in all such contributions being fully deductible when paid.
\item
  The terms of the 401(k) Plan shall continue to permit participation by Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis under Canadian income tax laws; provided, however, that a player shall not be eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan for the period of time during which the player is a Canadian Resident. If either (1) the NBA and the Players Association should determine that the 401(k) Plan cannot continue to be provided to Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis under Canadian income tax laws or (2) a Toronto Player is a Canadian Resident, Toronto shall provide an alternative arrangement for Toronto Players or, if applicable, the Canadian Resident, in lieu of the 401(k) Plan. The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon the type(s) of alternative arrangement to be provided. The costs of the alternative arrangement to be provided shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to Toronto equal to the annual cost that Toronto would have incurred under the 401(k) Plan with respect to the Toronto matching contributions. The cost to Toronto of providing for any such alternative arrangement (i) shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, and (ii) shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(2) below.
\item
  All costs, including the cost of Professional Fees, incurred in connection with the determination and implementation of any alternative arrangement pursuant to Section 2(b) and/or Section 2(d) shall be (1) paid by the Teams, (2) applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, and (3) limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(2).
\item
  Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement: (1) if any change or amendment made to the Code, ERISA, or to any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed) or rulings issued thereunder; (2) if any interpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation, application or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder; (3) if any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed) or rulings issued by the IRS under the Code or ERISA; or (4) if any provisions of this Agreement would result in the 401(k) Plan no longer being a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, or would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and above any costs required to be incurred to implement the provisions of this Agreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement in order for the 401(k) Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the Code (provided, however, that such additional costs are incurred solely in connection with the provision of benefits to their non-player employees or to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation to maintain and/or make contributions to the 401(k) Plan pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of 401(k) benefits to the players, (ii) to lockout, or (iii) to strike. In the event of such termination, the NBA Teams shall provide an alternative arrangement to the players. The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon the type(s) of alternative arrangement to be provided. The alternative arrangement to be provided shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams equal to the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the 401(k) Plan with respect to Team matching contributions commencing on the date of termination. The cost of funding of any such alternative arrangement (x) shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided by Section 8 below, and (y) shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(2) below.

  All capitalized terms used in this Section 2 not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the 401(k) Plan.

\item
  The SBP Trust and the Supplemental Benefit Plan shall be operated and administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid to the SBP Trust.

Any such alternative arrangement shall be operated and administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid; and, no matter how funded, the costs offunding for any alternative to the Supplemental Benefit Plan shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(7) below, and shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any right (1) to unilaterally implement, during the term of this Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of benefits provided or to be provided by the Supplemental Benefit Plan, (2) to lockout, or (3) to strike.

The cost to Toronto of funding for any such alternative arrangement shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(7) below, and shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

Effective with the date of this Agreement, the NBA and the Players Association shall cause to be established for the 2011-12 Season, and continuing until the expiration or termination of this Agreement, a program providing benefits including, but not limited to, new welfare benefits, to be established and operated through a voluntary employees' beneficiary association and related plan (the ``New VEBA'') and, commencing no later than the 2012-13 Season, a post-employment annuity benefit plan (the ``PEP'') as described in more detail below.

    The New VEBA shall be established and maintained for the purpose of providing benefits as permitted under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (and the regulations issued thereunder) to eligible vested players (using the same vesting rules as set forth under the Supplemental Benefit Plan) and their dependents, in a manner intended by the NBA and the Players Association to qualify as a tax-exempt organization under the provisions of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. The terms of, and the benefits to be provided under, the New VEBA shall be negotiated by the NBA and the Players Association. The NBA and the Players Association shall cooperate in seeking qualification of the New VEBA as a tax-exempt organization and the New VEBA shall be operated and administered so as to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (and the regulations issued thereunder). The daily operations of the New VEBA shall be administered by an independent third-party administrator, as selected by the NBA and the Players Association.
  \item
    The New VEBA shall be structured and maintained in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian tax laws) when paid to the New VEBA. If any Team is disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part) for such contributions, and unless the NBA determines otherwise, the obligation to maintain and to make further contributions to the New VEBA shall immediately terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (i) to unilaterally implement, during the term of this Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of benefits provided or to be provided by the New VEBA, (ii) to lockout, or (iii) to strike.
  \item
    In the event of any termination pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) above, the NBA shall provide an alternative arrangement for the players. The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon the type(s) of alternative arrangement to be provided. Such alternative arrangement shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be funded by such monies as may then remain in the New VEBA (or any trust holding contributions to such plan); if the monies remaining in the New VEBA may not lawfully be used for, or are insufficient for, such purpose, such alternative arrangement shall be funded, by the Teams; provided the annual cost incurred by the Teams in connection with funding such alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred to fund the New VEBA commencing on the date of termination. Any such alternative arrangement shall be operated and administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid.

  \item
    The PEP shall be established and maintained as a funded non-tax-qualified program for the purpose of purchasing annuities on behalf of Eligible Players (defined below) to provide a source of post-employment income (notwithstanding the foregoing, the NBA and the Players Association agree to meet and confer to discuss structuring the PEP as an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan). The daily operations of the PEP shall be administered by an independent third-party administrator, as selected by the NBA and the Players Association.
  \item
    Eligibility. A player shall be eligible to participate in the PEP for each ``PEP Year'' (November 1 through October 31) coinciding with a Regular Season in which this Section 4 is in effect (a ``Covered Regular Season''), provided that he is eligible to participate in the Supplemental Benefit Plan for that same Regular Season and is on a Team's Roster for such Regular Season (``Eligible Player'').
  \item
    PEP Benefit. For each Covered Regular Season, each Eligible Player will receive a benefit under the PEP equal to an amount to be negotiated between the NBA and Players Association for such Covered Regular Season (the ``BRI Deferral''). Commencing with the 2012-13 Season, in addition to the BRI Deferral, the Base Compensation of such Eligible Players for such Covered Regular Season shall be reduced by up to a maximum of ten percent (10\%); provided, however, that each Eligible Player may elect a Base Compensation reduction of either five percent (5\%) or ten percent (10\%) (the ``Player Deferral'' and, collectively, with the BRI Deferral, the ``PEP Benefit''); and provided, further, that prior to each Covered Regular Season an Eligible Player may opt out of the Player Deferral for that Covered Regular Season by timely submitting written notice of such election to the Eligible Player's Team. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the 2013-14 Season, the NBA and the Players Association shall engage in good faith negotiations over implementing the Player Deferral on a mandatory basis. The NBA and the Players Association shall engage in good faith negotiations over the procedures for implementing the Player Deferral. An Eligible Player's PEP Benefit is expected to be taxable as income to such Eligible Player and each Team will report, and withhold from, such amount as it deems necessary to satisfy any federal, state, local or other tax of any kind. The PEP Benefit shall be used to purchase annuities for Eligible Players in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with terms and conditions to be set forth in the PEP (``PEP Annuities''). The amount of the PEP Benefit to be applied toward the purchase of the PEP Annuities in respect of an Eligible Player for a Covered Regular Season shall be the PEP Benefit with respect to such Eligible Player for such Covered Season less the amount of the Eligible Player's portion of any applicable federal, state, local or other withholding taxes of any kind attributable to the PEP Benefit (the ``After-Tax PEP Benefit''). Each Eligible Player will be fully vested in the PEP Benefit and the PEP Annuities purchased on his behalf, and the payments pursuant to the PEP Annuities shall become payable to the player on the later of (i) the 12-month anniversary of the last Regular Season game of the player's last Regular Season or (ii) the 6-month anniversary of the player's 30th birthday. At the Eligible Player's election, the PEP Annuities will be payable in the form of either (i) installment payments until the player attains age 50, (ii) a single life annuity over the player's life, or (iii) a joint life annuity paid over the player's life and his surviving spouse's life. In the event of the death of a player prior to the commencement of payments from a PEP Annuity, payments from such PEP Annuity shall be made to the player's surviving spouse (or to the player's designated beneficiary, if either the player is not married or the surviving spouse consents to a non-spouse beneficiary) in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the player's death. In the event of the death of a player following commencement of payments from a PEP Annuity, any remaining payments from such PEP Annuity shall be payable to the player's surviving spouse (or the player's designated beneficiary, if either the player is not married or the surviving spouse consents to a non-spouse beneficiary), in accordance with the player's payment election and the terms of such PEP Annuity.
  \item
    Team Contributions. The obligation of the Teams to provide benefits under the PEP for Eligible Players for a Covered Regular Season shall be satisfied by the Teams (i) paying sums into the PEP in the aggregate amount of the After-Tax PEP Benefits on behalf of each of its Eligible Players, which shall be made not later than September 1 following the end of the Regular Season to which the PEP Benefit relates, and (ii) by remitting all applicable withholding and payroll taxes attributable to such PEP Benefit to the IRS and/or state and local taxing authorities. For purposes of this Section, the applicable estimated federal, state and local income taxes attributable to the PEP Benefit shall be equal to the amount of the PEP Benefit multiplied by the sum of the maximum federal, state and local income tax rates in effect in the applicable locale for the calendar year in which the PEP Benefit is made.

    Limitations on PEP.

    \item
      If the PEP Benefit attributable to Eligible Players would be subject to a federal income tax rate higher than the rate that would apply if the PEP Benefit were paid as Base Compensation, then any obligation to maintain the PEP pursuant to this Agreement shall, at the option of the Players Association, terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (x) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of post-employment benefits to the players, (y) to lockout, or (z) to strike.
    \item
      In the event of a termination described in Section 4(b)(5)(i) or (ii), the NBA shall provide an alternative arrangement for the players. The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon the type(s) of alternative arrangement to be provided, which shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to the Teams equal to the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the PEP on the date of termination.

\item
  For each Season, except as provided below, one percent (1\%) of BRI for such Season (the ``Additional Benefit Amount'') shall be used first to fund the New VEBA (or any alternative arrangement) for that Season and, to the extent any amount remains in the Additional Benefit Amount after funding the New VEBA, to fund the BRI Deferral component of the PEP (or any alternative arrangement) for that Season, unless the NBA and the Players Association agree to a different funding priority between the New VEBA and BRI Deferral component of the PEP. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Additional Benefit Amount for a Season shall be subject to reduction or elimination pursuant to Article VII, Section 12(b)(1). For purposes of all calculations called for under this Agreement of, or relating to, Benefits (including, but not limited to, for purposes of (i) preparing the Audit Report, Interim Audit Report, or Interim Escrow Audit Report, and (ii) calculating Total Benefits, Total Salaries and Benefits, and Projected Benefits), the amount to be included with respect to the Additional Benefit Amount shall be the full Additional Benefit Amount specified in this Section 4(c) and not the reduced Additional Benefit Amount provided for under Article VII, Section 12(b)(1).
\item
  All costs of Professional Fees incurred in connection with the implementation, operation and administration of the New VEBA (or any attendant alternative arrangement) and PEP (or any attendant alternative arrangement) shall be (i) paid by the Teams, (ii) applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, and (iii) limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(6) below.
\item
  The New VEBA and PEP shall be established and funded as forth in this Section 4, provided, however that (i) this Section 4 does not by itself create any other rights or obligations, and (ii) the specific benefits to be provided under each such plan shall be governed by a definitive written plan, agreement and/or other documentation implementing such plan(s). Such documentation shall address the eligibility and participation of Toronto Players and Canadian Residents in any such New VEBA and PEP (or in any attendant alternative arrangement).

      forty percent (40\%) of the gross proceeds, net of Taxes, from the sale of fixed arena signage within or outside of the arena in which an NBA Team plays more than one-half of its Regular Season home games, including, without limitation, such proceeds received or to be received by a Related Party (in accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below);
    \item
      forty percent (40\%) of the gross proceeds of any kind, net of Taxes, from the sale, lease or licensing of luxury suites calculated on the basis of the actual proceeds received by the entity, including, without limitation, proceeds received or to be received by a Related Party (in accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below), that sold, leased, or licensed such luxury suites; provided, however, that, other than the additional amounts paid by luxury suite holders to the Team for tickets pursuant to arrangements in which admission to games is not part of the agreement to buy, lease or license the luxury suite, thereby requiring the luxury suiteholder to make a separate payment for such admission, if any, this amount shall be the only amount included in BRI for the sale, lease or licensing of luxury suites and that, to the extent that the sale, lease or licensing of the luxury suite grants rights to the luxury suite for a period of more than one (1) year, for purposes of calculating the amount includable in BRI for any Salary Cap Year, the proceeds shall be determined on the basis of the annual fee or charge provided for in any such transaction and, if payments are made in addition to or in the absence of such an annual fee or charge, the value of such payments shall be amortized over the period of the sale, lease or license, unless such period exceeds twenty (20) years, in which event an amortization period of twenty (20) years shall be used;
    \item
      fifty percent (50\%) of the gross proceeds, net of Taxes, from arena naming rights agreements with respect to arenas in which an NBA Team plays more than one-half of its Regular Season home games, including, without limitation, such proceeds received or to be received by a Related Party (in accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below);
    \item
      except as provided in Section 1(a)(2) below, proceeds received by Properties or any other League-related entity, net of reasonable and customary expenses (including Taxes) related thereto, subject to the provisions of Section 1(a)(6) below, from the following: (A) international television; (B) sponsorships; (C) NBA-related revenues from NBA Entertainment; (D) the All-Star Game; (E) other NBA special events; and (F) all other sources of revenue received by Properties or any other League-related entity, in each case under (A)-(F), to the extent that such proceeds are related to the performance of Players in NBA basketball games or NBA-related activities;
    \item
      proceeds from premium seat licenses (other than licenses of luxury suites, which are governed by Section 1(a)(1)(vii) above), net of Taxes, attributable to NBA-related events amortized over the period of the license (including, without limitation, such proceeds received or to be received by a Related Party (in accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below), unless such period exceeds twenty (20) years, in which event an amortization period of twenty (20) years shall be used;
    \item
      fifty percent (50\%) of the gross proceeds, net of Taxes, from the sale of naming rights with respect to practice facilities used by NBA Teams, including, without limitation, such proceeds received or to be received by a Related Party (in accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below); and
    \item
      if the right to receive revenues included in BRI is sold or transferred to an entity other than an entity referred to in Section 1(a)(1) above (such that those revenues would not be included in BRI pursuant to that subsection), then BRI shall be deemed to include the amount of revenues that would have been received by the seller or transfer or and would have been included in BRI in such Salary Cap Year (subject to any applicable allocations provided for above), absent such sale or transfer, provided that a pledge, hypothecation, collateral assignment or other similar transaction involving such revenues, shall not be considered a sale or transfer within the meaning of this Section 1(a)(1)(xii).

    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section (a)(1) above, it is understood that the following is a non-exclusive list of examples of revenues that are or may be received by the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, other League-related entities, NBA Teams and Related Parties (the foregoing persons or entities, beginning with ``NBA,'' collectively referred to in this Section 1(a)(2) only as ``NBA-related entities'') that are not derived from, and do not relate to or arise out of, the performance of Players in NBA basketball games or in NBA-related activities or are otherwise expressly excluded from the definition of BRI:

    \item
      proceeds from the assignment of Player Contracts;

    \item
      payments made to Teams or to the NBA pursuant to the provisions of Article VII, Section 12 (Escrow and Tax Arrangement) below;
    \item
      distributions, dividends or royalties paid by any NBA-related entity to owners, shareholders, members or partners;

      any category or source of revenue or proceeds that was expressly identified in any BRI Report (as defined in Section 10(b) below) or in any document or written communication (including debriefing memos) authored by the Accountants and provided to the Players Association and the NBA (but excluding any underlying work papers) in connection with the Audit Reports for any of the 1995-96 through 2010-11 Salary Cap Years that was not included in BRI for such Salary Cap Years, unless such category or source was included on the ``open issues'' list prepared by the Accountants in connection with any of the Audit Reports for the 2005-06 through 2010-11 Salary Cap Years, in which case such category or source shall be included in or excluded from BRI, as the case may be, in accordance with the other terms of this Article;
    \item
      proceeds received by (A) Properties (and its related entities) pursuant to the Group License Agreement (including, but not limited to, proceeds received pursuant to the license of ``fantasy games,'' which proceeds are to be included in the computation of Player Merchandise Revenues in accordance with the Group License Agreement), or (B) a League-related entity relating to the following categories defined in the same manner as was used in the audited financial reports for Properties for the year ended July 31, 1997: (x) licensing; and/or (y) a League-related entity's representation of, and services performed for, third parties. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, ``third parties'' refers to persons or entities that are not owned or controlled by persons or entities that own a majority interest in or otherwise control an NBA Team or, if such third party is a Related Party, proceeds received by the League-related entity shall not be included in BRI if representation of such Related Party does not relate either to such entity's NBA ownership or NBA Players;
    \item
      monies collected from team-related fundraising for charitable purposes or other charitable activities, other than monies paid pursuant to Team sponsorship agreements that are included in BRI pursuant to Section 1(a)(1)(v) above; and

    \item
      any thing of value received from a concessionaire, food service vendor or other third party equipment or service provider that, if received in kind, is installed in an NBA arena or, if received in cash, is directed to defraying the costs of the construction or substantial renovation of an NBA arena.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    The parties agree that (i) in determining whether a category or source of revenue or proceeds constitutes BRI: (A) consideration shall be given to whether such category or source is more similar in kind or nature to the included categories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(1)(i) through (xii) above, on the one hand, or to the excluded categories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(2)(i) through (xx) above, on the other; and, (B) no inference may be drawn from the fact that such category or source was not included in the categories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(1)(i) through (xii) above, or the fact that such category or source was not included in the categories and sources listed in Sections 1(a)(2)(i) through (xx) above; and (ii) in any proceeding involving a dispute over (A) the includability or categorization of any revenue or expense item for BRI purposes; (B) the amount to be included in or deducted from BRI with respect to any revenue or expense item; or (C) the accounting methodology used by the Accountants in connection with any audit of BRI, the parties may refer to the past practice of the parties or the Accountants in connection with the Audit Reports for any of the 1999-2000 through 2010-11 Salary Cap Years; provided, however, that no reference may be made to the past practice of the parties or the Accountants with respect to any source or category of revenue or expense that was included on the ``open issues'' list prepared by the Accountants in connection with any of such Audit Reports; provided, further, that any such past practice shall be superseded to the extent changed or clarified by the terms of this Agreement.
  \item
    The parties agree that, with respect to any lease entered into after the date of this Agreement between a Team (or a Related Party) and an arena that is not a Related Party, the Accountants may attribute to the Team (or a Related Party) for purposes of computing BRI for a Salary Cap Year portions of arena revenues received by the arena or its related entities that would be included in BRI if received by the Team (or a Related Party) to the following extent: in the event of a renewal, extension or renegotiation of a lease between the same parties, or a new lease entered into by a Team (or a Related Party) with an arena that is not a Related Party, the Team will be deemed to receive in the first Salary Cap Year covered by the new lease or by the renewal, extension or renegotiation of the existing lease (as the case may be) the greater of (i) the amount of such revenues that the Team or the Related Party in fact receives under the lease or, (ii) if in the opinion of the Accountants, the Team (and/or the Related Party) is receiving substantially less than fair market value as determined by the Accountants (taking into account factors such as the rent paid by the Team or the Related Party, the number and identity of other major tenants in the arena, market conditions, the extent to which arena revenues are used to fund construction or renovations of the arena, and comparable lease arrangements in the NBA), an amount determined by the Accountants to constitute the fair market value of the revenues that a tenant, in the same circumstances as the Team or Related Party, would receive for such Salary Cap Year. In either of the preceding cases, the Accountants will also determine the amount to be included in BRI for Salary Cap Years beyond the first Salary Cap Year.

      In no event shall the same revenues be included in BRI, directly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result of changes in accounting methods or practices), the purpose of this provision being to preclude the double-counting of revenues, whether in the same or in multiple Salary Cap Years.
    \item
      In no event shall the same expenses be deducted from BRI, directly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result of changes in accounting methods or practices), the purpose of this provision being to preclude the double-counting of expenses, whether in the same or in multiple Salary Cap Years.

    Subject to Section 11 below (Players Association Audit Rights):

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      With respect to expenses incurred in connection with all proceeds coming within Section 1(a)(1)(v) above, all reported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be reasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not be the subject of the accounting procedures set forth in Section 10 below. Such expenses shall be disallowed, however, to the extent that they exceed the ratio of League-wide reported expenses to League-wide reported revenues (the ``Expense Ratio'') for that category of revenues set forth in Exhibit D hereto.
    \item
      With respect to expenses incurred in connection with all proceeds coming within Section 1(a)(ix) above that are consistent with the types and categories of expenses incurred by Properties as reflected in the audited financial reports of Properties for the year ended July 31, 1994, (1) all such reported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be reasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not be the subject of the accounting procedures set forth in Section 10 below, but (2) such expenses shall be disallowed to the extent they exceed the Expense Ratio for the category of revenues set forth in Exhibit D hereto.
    \item
      With respect to the NBA Store (the ``Store'') and any other new venture or business (whether or not involving the creation of a new entity) undertaken by the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, or any other League-related entity requiring significant capital investment or start-up costs (``New Venture''), the League-related entities shall be able to deduct from BRI reasonable and customary expenses related thereto, including, but not be limited to, cost of goods sold, sales tax, all reasonable operating expenses of the Store or New Venture (including, but not limited to, salaries and benefits directly related to the operations of the Store or New Venture, promotional and advertising costs, rent, direct overhead, general and administrative expenses of the Store or New Venture), reasonable financing costs and amortization of capital improvements and start-up costs; provided, however, that in no event shall the expenses attributable to the Store or New Venture cause the amount included in BRI for the Store or New Venture to be less than zero (0) for any Salary Cap Year.
    \item
      With respect to new categories of revenue that may be included in BRI during the term of this Agreement (other than revenues attributable to the Store or a New Venture), the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, other League-related entities, NBA Teams and Related Parties shall be able to deduct all expenses that the parties agree (or, in the absence of such agreement, that the Accountants determine) are reasonable and customary, provided, however, that if a new category of revenue is substantially similar to the type of revenues described in Section 1(a)(1)(i) and (iv) above, the expenses attributable to such new category of revenue shall be deductible only to the extent contemplated by such subsections.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    It is acknowledged by the parties hereto that for purposes of determining BRI:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Some NBA Teams have engaged or may engage in transactions with third parties that control, or own at least fifty percent (50\%) of, the NBA Team or that are controlled or owned at least fifty percent (50\%) by the persons or entities controlling or owning at least fifty percent (50\%) of the NBA Team (such third parties are referred to in this Agreement as a ``Related Party''), and Related Parties themselves engage in transactions with third parties that may result in a Related Party's receipt of revenues that constitute BRI. (Any entity that was an ``entity related to an NBA team'' as defined by Article VII, Section 1(a)(4)(i) of the September 18, 1995 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the NBA and the Players Association (the ``1995 CBA'') shall be deemed a Related Party under this Agreement for so long as such entity continues to be an entity related to an NBA Team within the meaning of the 1995 CBA.) As provided in Section 1(a)(1) above, the relevant proceeds received by any Related Party that come within such subsection and that relate to such Related Party's Team shall be included in BRI. However, except in connection with telecast agreements (which are subject to Section 1(a)(7)(ii) below), with respect to any such revenues or proceeds retained or received by a Related Party (other than arena revenues that relate to such Related Party's Team including, but not limited to, in-arena sales of novelties and concessions, NBA game parking, arena club revenues, suite and seat revenues and fixed and temporary in-arena signage, which shall be included in BRI as if received by the Team), or by a Team pursuant to a transaction with a Related Party, such revenues or proceeds shall be included in BRI only to the extent that the NBA and the Players Association agree or, if they fail to agree, the Accountants shall reasonably determine the amount, if any, of such revenues or proceeds to attribute to the Team (taking into account factors such as the nature of the transaction, arrangement and/or relationship between the Team and the Related Party or between the Related Party and a third party, any amounts included in BRI with respect to other Teams (or Related Parties) that have entered into comparable transactions, arrangements and/or relationships with third parties, market conditions, the nature of any services or activities performed by the Related Party for, or in connection with, the generation of revenues or proceeds and the amount of revenues or proceeds that the Related Party would be expected to retain or receive with respect to comparable transactions, arrangements and/or relationships with third parties), and the amount so attributed shall be the only amount included in BRI. To the extent that the amount of such proceeds to be included in BRI cannot reasonably be determined with respect to any particular transaction, the Accountants shall determine a reasonable amount with respect to such transaction, which shall be included in BRI. (In the event the Accountants refuse to make any such determination, such determination shall be made by a jointly selected expert with respect to any such transaction.) Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall BRI include consideration paid to a Related Party in connection with rights acquired by such Related Party from a Team for fair market value, even if such consideration relates to NBA games or NBA-related activities (including, by way of example and not limitation, advertising revenue or subscriber fees earned by a Related Party television network that relate, directly or indirectly, to the telecast of NBA games licensed to the television network by a Team).
    \item
      In the event that, following the execution of this Agreement, a Team (other than the New York Knicks (``Knicks'')) enters into a local or regional telecast agreement with a Related Party, a copy of such agreement shall be provided to the Players Association within ten (10) days of approval of such agreement by the NBA. The Players Association and the NBA shall each have the right, not later than ten (10) days following the date on which the Players Association receives a copy of such agreement, to submit such agreement to a jointly-selected television valuation expert or (in the absence of such agreement) determined in accordance with the procedure set forth in this subsection (``TV Expert'') for the limited purpose set forth in this Section 1(a)(7)(ii). In the event that a party has so elected to submit such agreement to a TV Expert and the parties have not jointly selected a TV Expert within twenty (20) days following the date on which the Players Association receives a copy of such agreement, each party shall appoint its own television valuation designee and the two designees so appointed shall within ten (10) days of their appointment, jointly select a third party to serve as the TV Expert. Such TV Expert shall review such agreement to determine if the aggregate amount to be paid to the Team by the Related Party for the rights to telecast the Team's games pursuant to such agreement is more than fifteen percent (15\%) above or more than fifteen percent (15\%) below the fair market value of such rights over the term of such agreement. In making such determination, the TV Expert may take into account factors such as the nature of the transaction, arrangement and/or relationship between the Team and the Related Party, any amounts included in BRI with respect to other Teams (or Related Parties) that have entered into comparable transactions, arrangements and/or relationships with other programming licensors, market conditions, the nature of any services or activities performed by the Related Party for, or in connection with, the generation of revenues or proceeds and the amount of revenues or proceeds that the Related Party would be expected to retain or receive with respect to comparable transactions, arrangements and/or relationships with third parties; provided that in no event shall BRI include consideration paid to a Related Party in connection with rights acquired by such Related Party from a Team for fair market value, even if such consideration relates to NBA games or NBA-related activities (including, by way of example and not limitation, advertising revenue or subscriber fees earned by a Related Party television network that relate, directly or indirectly, to the telecast of NBA games licensed to the television network by a Team). In the event that the TV Expert determines that such aggregate amount is more than fifteen percent (15\%) above or below fair market value, the TV Expert shall be instructed to submit to the parties the amount for each Season of such agreement that he determines reflects the fair market value of such rights and such amounts, and no other amounts, shall be included in BRI with respect to such agreement for each Salary Cap Year covered by such agreement. Any determination made by the TV Expert pursuant to either of the preceding two sentences shall be submitted to the parties no later than twenty (20) days from the date on which such agreement was submitted to the TV Expert for his review. Any fees or costs associated with the retention or determination of the TV Expert shall be borne equally by the Players Association and NBA. The Players Association and the TV Expert shall maintain the confidentiality of any such agreement (and any determination made by the TV expert in accordance with this Section 1(a)(7)(ii)) pursuant to the terms of Section 11(c) below relating to confidentiality of BRI Audits.
    \item
      With respect to the transactions listed below in this Section 1(a)(7)(iii), the parties agree that, because the proceeds attributable to these transactions cannot be accurately ascertained, the following procedures shall be used for each NBA Season in which MSG Network is a Related Party of the Knicks (in the case of Section 1(a)(7)(iii)(A) below) and the Madison Square Garden arena is a Related Party of the Knicks (in the case of Section 1(a)(7)(iii)(B) below):

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{(\Alph{enumiv})}
      \tightlist
      \item
        New York Knicks transaction with MSG Network regarding the sale of local media rights: BRI for the Knicks for each NBA Season covered by this Agreement shall include an amount equal to the net proceeds included in BRI attributable to the Los Angeles Lakers' sale, license or other conveyance of all local media rights (including, but not limited to, broadcast and cable television and radio) for such NBA season.
      \item
        New York Knicks transactions with Related Parties involving signage: BRI for the Knicks for the 1999-2000 NBA Season shall include \$3,750,000 for signage. In each subsequent Season covered by this Agreement, this amount shall be increased (or decreased, as the case may be) by the League-wide percentage increase (or decrease) in signage as determined in accordance with Section 1(a)(1)(v) and (a)(1)(vi) above.
      \end{enumerate}

      At such time as the MSG Network and/or the Madison Square Garden Arena are no longer Related Parties, BRI for the New York Knicks in the categories described in Section 1(a)(7)(iii)(A) and/or (B) above, as the case may be, shall not be determined in accordance with the foregoing and will instead be determined by the applicable provisions of Section 1(a)(1) and (a)(7)(ii) above.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    In the event that, pursuant to the NBA's national broadcast, national telecast and network cable television agreements, NBA Teams receive revenue sharing proceeds that are attributable to NBA game telecasts in more than one Salary Cap Year, such proceeds shall be allocated over the same number of Salary Cap Years (beginning with first Salary Cap Year after the Salary Cap Year in which such proceeds are actually received) as the number of Salary Cap Years in which such games were televised. Any other contingent payments received by the NBA pursuant to such agreements shall be included in BRI to the extent and in a manner agreed upon by the parties, or, if the parties cannot agree, in a reasonable manner determined by the Accountants.
  \item
    The NBA and each NBA Team shall in good faith act and use their commercially reasonable efforts to increase BRI for each Salary Cap Year during the term of this Agreement. In the exercise of such commercially reasonable efforts, the NBA and each NBA Team shall be entitled to act in a manner consistent with their reasonable business judgment and shall not (i) take any action intended to benefit, at the expense of BRI, other commercial activities (such as the WNBA and the NBADL) unrelated to the performance of Players in NBA basketball games or in NBA-related activities, or (ii) shift or forgo revenues attributable to Salary Cap Years during the term of this Agreement in exchange for revenues or benefits during Salary Cap Years following the expiration of this Agreement (unless there is a reasonable business justification unrelated to collective bargaining for such shift or forgoing). There shall be no obligation on the part of the NBA or any NBA Team to accelerate into Salary Cap Years within the term of this Agreement revenues attributable to Salary Cap Years following the expiration of this Agreement. In evaluating compliance with this subsection, the parties and the System Arbitrator shall consider and give substantial weight to the reasonable business judgment of the NBA or the NBA Team but no deference will be applied where the NBA is alleged to have shifted or forgone revenues of \$350 million or more for the purpose of securing leverage in collective bargaining, in which case any finding of non-compliance shall require proof by a clear preponderance of the evidence. The following is a list of decisions in respect of which the business judgment of the NBA or an NBA Team shall conclusively be deemed reasonable: membership location; arena capacity or configuration; number and location of games played; whether to outsource or operate a line of business; and whether to accept or decline a sponsorship, advertising or naming rights opportunity. The foregoing list shall not limit in any manner the circumstances in which the business judgment of the NBA or an NBA Team may be deemed reasonable.
  \item
    The parties agree that upon a finding by the System Arbitrator (which, if appealed, is affirmed by the Appeals Panel) that the NBA or an NBA Team (or a Related Party) has willfully failed to provide to the Accountants information concerning revenues or expenses material to the Accountants' preparation of an Audit Report, and that such failure to provide information resulted in an understatement of BRI of more than \$3,250,000 with respect to the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year (increasing by four and one-half percent (4.5\%) for each subsequent Salary Cap Year of this Agreement, beginning with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year), then the amount by which BRI was understated shall be included in BRI in the Salary Cap Year in which such finding is made, with interest accruing from the date of the Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year in which such amount would have been included but for such understatement, with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the date of the issuance of such Audit Report). In addition, if any Team, or if the NBA, violates the foregoing, it shall be fined \$3 million for its first violation during the term of this Agreement and an additional \$1.5 million for each additional violation. (For example, if a Team violates the foregoing for the first time, it shall be fined \$3 million; if such Team violates the foregoing a second time, it shall be fined \$4.5 million; and if such Team violates the foregoing a third time, it shall be fined \$6 million.) Fifty percent (50\%) of any such fine amounts shall be remitted by the NBA to an NBPA-Selected Charitable Organization (as defined in Article VI, Section 6 above) and fifty percent (50\%) shall be remitted by the NBA to a Section 501(c)(3) organization selected by the NBA.
  \item
    Neither the NBA or a League-related entity nor a Team or a Related Party will enter into any lease or other agreement providing for the receipt of revenues includable in BRI that contains provisions that purport to limit access of the Accountants to the books and records of the NBA, such League-related entity, such Team, or such Related Party in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or that would preclude the calculation of revenues (if any) to be included in BRI pursuant to the provisions of Section 1(a)(1)(xii) above.
  \item
    Premium payments made by a Team for any insurance that, if paid, would be includable in BRI pursuant to Section 1(a)(2)(ix) above, shall be deducted from such Team's BRI for the Salary Cap Year in which any such insurance recovery is received.

    \tightlist
    \item
      The value of equity securities received by NBA-related entities (as defined in Section 1(a)(2) above) in entities that were not NBA-related entities prior to such receipt, to the extent otherwise constituting BRI under this Agreement, shall be included in BRI as follows:

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{(\Alph{enumiv})}
      \tightlist
      \item
        if the equity securities (including contingent securities, as defined below) are Publicly Tradable when received, the Publicly Traded Value of those securities will be included in BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which they are received;
      \item
        if the equity securities consist of options, warrants, convertible securities or similar securities (``contingent securities''), and (x) those contingent securities are sold, the Net Proceeds will be included in BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which the sale occurs, or (y) those contingent securities are exercised or converted into other securities that are or become Publicly Tradable, the Publicly Traded Value of the resulting securities (net of any exercise or conversion price and taxes, as determined below) will be included in BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which the exercise or conversion occurs (if the resulting securities were Publicly Tradable at that time) or in the Salary Cap Year in which the resulting securities later become Publicly Tradable, whichever is first;
      \item
        if the equity securities (including contingent securities and any securities resulting from the exercise or conversion of contingent securities) are not Publicly Tradable at the time of receipt (or, in the case of contingent securities, at the time of exercise or conversion), no BRI value shall be attributable to suchsecurities until they become Publicly Tradable or are sold or otherwise transferred for consideration other than securities that are not Publicly Tradable, whichever is first, at which time the Publicly Traded Value or Net Proceeds, as applicable, will be included n BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which such event occurs; or
      \item
        notwithstanding the foregoing, if any contingent securities are exercisable or convertible into securities that are or become Publicly Tradable, but those contingent securities are not exercised or converted within one (1) year of any such right, the Players Association shall have the right, by written notice to the NBA, to have the Publicly Traded Value of such securities included in BRI as if those contingent securities had been exercised or converted on the date of such notice (net of any exercise or conversion price and taxes, as determined below).
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      For purposes of this Section 1(a)(13), (A) ``Publicly Tradable'' means (x) the applicable equity securities have been registered for sale under applicable state, federal and foreign laws, are listed and tradable on a generally recognized stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market, or (y) the applicable equity securities can be readily purchased and sold on a nationally recognized secondary market (e.g., without limitation on any example, shares in ``Facebook'' as of the date of this Agreement), and in each case under (x) and (y), any contractual or other prohibition or limitation on sale would not preclude a sale; (B) ``Publicly Traded Value'' means the weighted average daily trading price of the applicable equity securities for the thirty (30) trading days (x) preceding the date of receipt if the securities are Publicly Tradable prior to that date or (y) following the date they become Publicly Tradable; provided that if such equity securities are sold during the Salary Cap Year in which their Publicly Traded Value is first included in BRI, the ``Publicly Traded Value'' of such equity securities shall be the Net Proceeds from such sale; (C) ``Net Proceeds'' means the proceeds received by the selling entity from the applicable sale, net of commissions and reasonable expenses relating to such sale, any exercise or conversion price with respect to securities resulting from the exercise or conversion of contingent securities, and any applicable taxes of the selling entity (or if the selling entity is a pass-through entity for income tax purposes, such entity's owners), which shall be determined using an assumed tax rate equivalent to the highest marginal combined federal, state and local tax rate that would be applicable in New York City; and (D) a sale of equity securities shall not be subject to inclusion in BRI if the sale is part of a larger transaction in which (x) BRI has been fully accounted for or (y) all or substantially all of the assets of an NBA-related entity or business unit thereof are sold and such equity securities do not represent a majority of the value in such transaction. In all cases, the Publicly Traded Value of, or Net Proceeds from, the applicable equity securities will be included in BRI over a seven (7) year amortization period (inclusive of the Salary Cap Year in which such Publicly Traded Value is first included in BRI), even if such equity securities are sold during such seven (7) year period.
    \item
      For the avoidance of doubt, (A) in no event shall the value of, or proceeds or distributions from, equity securities in NBA-related entities be included in BRI, and (B) the value of, or proceeds or distributions from, equity securities in non-NBA-related entities shall be included in BRI exclusively pursuant to this Section 1(a)(13), and only once under the applicable provision of Section 1(a)(13)(i) above.

    Except as otherwise provided in the case of luxury suites and premium seat licenses, in no event shall the amortization period for any lump sum payment exceed seven (7) years.
  \item

In the event that a payment that has been included in BRI is subsequently repaid, BRI shall be reduced by the amount of such repayment in the Salary Cap Year in which such repayment is made. In any proceeding commenced before the System Arbitrator relating to the terms of this Section 1(b)(3), the NBA will bear the burden of demonstrating that the applicable Contingencies are likely to occur.

    The Salary Cap for a Salary Cap Year will be in effect commencing on the day following the last day of the Moratorium Period in such Salary Cap Year and shall continue through and including the last day of the Moratorium Period in the next Salary Cap Year.

For each Salary Cap Year thereafter during the term of this Agreement, there shall be a Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety percent (90\%) of the Salary Cap for such Salary Cap Year.
  \item
    In the event that a Team's Team Salary for a Salary Cap Year as of the start of the Team's last Regular Season game of that Salary Cap Year is less than the applicable Minimum Team Salary for that Salary Cap Year, the NBA shall cause such Team to make payments equal to the shortfall (to be disbursed to the players on such Team pro rata or in accordance with such other formula as may be reasonably determined by the Players Association). The Players Association shall provide the NBA with its proposed distribution of any such shortfall within thirty (30) days after the completion of the Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year. The NBA shall cause the Team to make the required payments, less all amounts required to be withheld be any governmental authority, within ten (10) business days after receipt of the proposed distribution from the Players Association in accordance with the preceding sentence. For purposes of this Section 2(b), and subject to subsection (4) below, a Team's Team Salary for a Salary Cap Year shall be calculated in the same manner as Team Salary is calculated by the Accountants for purposes of computing Total Salaries and Benefits in the Audit Report (as defined in Section 10(a)(1) below).

  \item
    During the second Salary Cap Year in which it begins play, an Expansion Team shall have a Salary Cap equal to eighty percent (80\%) of the Salary Cap applicable to all other Teams (the ``Second Year Expansion Team Salary Cap''); and shall have a Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety percent (90\%) of the Second Year Expansion Team Salary Cap.

  \textbf{Adjustments to Salary Cap and Minimum Team Salary.}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the event that Total Salaries and Benefits for any Salary Cap Year beginning with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year are less than the Designated Share (as defined in Section 12(b)(3) below) for such Salary Cap Year, then the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be increased by the amount of the shortfall divided by the number of Teams in the NBA during such subsequent Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA).
  \item
    In the event that there is an Overage (as defined in Section 12(a)(14) below) in any Salary Cap Year beginning with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year, then the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be adjusted as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      If the amount of the Overage in a Salary Cap Year is equal to or less than six percent (6\%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then no adjustments shall be made to the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year.
    \item
      If the amount of the Overage in a Salary Cap Year equals more than six percent (6\%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by an amount to be calculated as follows:\\
      STEP 1: Subtract six percent (6\%) of Total Salaries and Benefits from the Overage.\\
      STEP 2: If Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year does not exceed BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year by more than eight percent (8\%) of BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year or the amount of the Overage described above exceeds nine percent(9\%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then divide the result of Step 1 by the number of Teams in the NBA during the subsequent Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The result of this calculation is the amount of the reduction in the Salary Cap for such subsequent Salary Cap Year, and no further steps are required.\\
      If Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year exceeds BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year by more than eight percent (8\%) of BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year and the amount of the Overage described above does not exceed nine percent (9\%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then proceed to Step 3.\\
      STEP 3: Subtract BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year from Projected BRI for the Salary Cap Year.\\
      STEP 4: Subtract eight percent (8\%) of BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year from the result of Step 3.\\
      STEP 5: Multiply the result of Step 4 by forty-four and seventy-four one hundredths percent (44.74\%).\\
      STEP 6: Subtract the result of Step 5 from the result of Step 1. If the result of this step is less than zero, then no adjustments shall be made to the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year, and no further steps are required.\\
      STEP 7: Divide the result of Step 6 by the number of Teams in the NBA during such subsequent Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The result of this step is the amount of the reduction in the Salary Cap for such subsequent Salary Cap Year.\\
      \emph{Example: Assume Total Salaries and Benefits for the 2013-14 Season are \$2.27 billion and the Designated Share is \$2.1 billion resulting in an Overage of \$170 million (which equals 7.5\% of Total Salaries and Benefits). Assume Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season (\$4.41 billion) exceeds actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2 billion) by 5\%. Assume there are 30 Teams in the NBA in 2014-15. The Salary Cap for the 2014-15 Season would be reduced by \$1.1 million ((7.5\% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$170 million) less 6\% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$136 million)) divided by 30).}\\
      \emph{Example: Same Total Salaries and Benefits as in the prior example, except assume Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season (\$4.578 billion) exceeds actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2 billion) by 9\%. The Salary Cap for the 2014-15 Season would be reduced by \$0.50 million (\$34 million (the Overage of 7.5\% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$170 million) less 6\% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$136 million)), less \$19 million (i.e., the difference between (x) Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season (\$4.578 billion) less actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2 billion) (i.e., \$378 million) and (y) 8\% of actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (i.e., \$336 million) -- a difference of \$42 million -- multiplied by 44.74\%), divided by 30).}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    In the event that the Salary Cap for a Salary Cap Year is calculated based upon an Interim Audit Report for the prior Salary Cap Year in accordance with Section 2(a)(4) above and BRI and Total Salaries and Benefits as set forth in the Audit Report for the prior Salary Cap Year are different from those in the Interim Audit Report such that the Salary Cap would have been different from that based upon the Interim Audit Report, any such difference in the Salary Cap shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year, except that, with respect to the 2020-21 Salary Cap Year (or, in the alternative, if either the NBA or Players Association exercises its option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article XXXIX, the 2016-17 Salary Cap Year) any such differences shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to the Salary Cap for the then current Salary Cap Year, in all such cases with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the issuance of the Interim Audit Report).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Guarantee.} In the event that for any Salary Cap Year Total Salaries and Benefits is less than the Designated Share (as defined in Section 12(b)(3) below) for such Salary Cap Year, the difference shall be paid by the NBA to the Players Association no later than thirty (30) days following the completion of the Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year for distribution to all NBA players who were on an NBA roster during the Season covered by such Salary Cap Year on such proportional basis as may be reasonably determined by the Players Association. The Players Association shall provide the NBA with its proposed distribution of any such guarantee payment within thirty (30) days after the completion of the Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.

    \emph{Proration:} Any signing bonus contained in a Player Contract shall be allocated over the number of Salary Cap Years (or over the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Years in the case of a signing bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above) covered by such Contract in proportion to the percentage of Base Compensation in each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of allocation, is protected for lack of skill; provided, however, that if the Player Contract provides for an Early Termination Option (``ETO''), the foregoing allocation shall be performed only over Salary Cap Years that precede the Effective Season of such ETO. In the event that, at the time of allocation, none of the Base Compensation provided for by a Player Contract (or none of the then-current or remaining Base Compensation in the case of a signing bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above) is protected for lack of skill, then the entire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the first Salary Cap Year of the Contract (or, in the case of a signing bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above, the Salary Cap Year during which the player's Contract is traded).
  \item
    \emph{Extensions:}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      In the event that a Team with a Team Salary at or over the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus, such signing bonus shall be paid no sooner than the first day of the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term and shall be allocated, in equal parts, over the number of Salary Cap Years covered by the extended term in proportion to the percentage of Base Compensation in each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of allocation, is protected for lack of skill. In the event that, at the time of the allocation, none of the Base Compensation provided for during the extended term is protected for lack of skill, then the entire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the first Salary Cap Year of the extended term.
    \item
      A Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may enter into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus to be paid at any time during the Contract's original or extended term. In the event that a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus to be paid no sooner than the first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by such extended term, the bonus shall be allocated in accordance with the proration rules set forth in Section 3(b)(3)(i) above. In the event a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus to be paid prior to the first day of the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term, the following rules shall apply:

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{(\Alph{enumiv})}
      \tightlist
      \item
        The signing bonus shall be allocated over the remaining Salary Cap Years (including the then-current Salary Cap Year) under the original term of the Contract and the extended term in proportion to the percentage of Base Compensation in each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of allocation, is protected for lack of skill. In the event that, at the time of allocation, none of the Base Compensation provided for during the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Years under the original term of the Contract or during the extended term is protected for lack of skill, then the entire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the Salary Cap Year during which the Extension is signed; and
      \item
        The Extension shall be deemed a Renegotiation and shall be subject to the rules governing Renegotiations set forth in Section 7 below.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Loans to Players.} The following rules shall apply to any loan made by any Team to a player:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If any such loan bears no interest (or annual interest at an effective rate lower than the ``Target Rate'' (as defined below)), then the interest shall be imputed on the outstanding balance at a rate equal to the difference between the Target Rate and the actual rate of interest to be paid by the player and such imputed interest shall be included in the player's Salary. The ``Target Rate'' means the ``Prime Rate'' (as defined below) plus one percent (1\%) as of the date the loan is agreed upon, except that the ``Target Rate'' shall be no lower than seven percent (7\%) or greater than nine percent (9\%). For purposes of this Section 3(c)(1), ``Prime Rate'' means the prime rate reported in the ``Money Rates'' column or any successor column of the Wall Street Journal.
  \item
    No loan made to a player may (along with other outstanding loans to the player) exceed the amount of the player's Salary for the then-current Salary Cap Year that is protected for lack of skill. All loans must be repaid through deductions from the player's remaining Current Base Compensation over the years of the Contract that, at the time the loan is agreed upon, provide for Base Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill (prior to the Effective Season of any ETO) in equal annual amounts (the ``annual allocable repayment amounts''). If a loan is made at atime when the remaining Current Base Compensation due for the relevant Season that is fully protected for lack of skill is less than the annual allocable repayment amount that would be owed on a loan for the full amount of the player's Current Base Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill for the relevant Season (the ``maximum annual allocable repayment amount''), the maximum loan amount for that Season shall be reduced by the amount by which the maximum annual allocable repayment amount exceeds the amount of remaining Current Base Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill. (For example, if a Player has \$1 million in Current Base Compensation (fully protected for lack of skill) in the first Season of a five-year Contract, and a loan is made during that Season at a time when the Player has already received his Current Base Compensation for that Season, the loan may not exceed \$800,000.)
  \item
    In addition to the restrictions set forth in Section 3(c)(2) above: (i) no loan may be made that would result in a violation of Article II, Section 12(e); and (ii) no loan may be made to a player whose Contract provides for Base Compensation equal to the Minimum Player Salary.
  \item
    Any forgiveness by a Team of a loan to a player shall be deemed a Renegotiation in the Salary Cap Year of such forgiveness and shall be subject to the rules governing Renegotiations set forth in Section 7 below.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Incentive Compensation.}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For purposes of determining a player's Salary each Salary Cap Year, except as provided in Sections 3(d)(2)-(4) below, any Performance Bonus (provided such Performance Bonus may be included in a Player Contract in accordance with Section 5(d) below), shall be included in Salary only if such Performance Bonus would be earned if the Team's or player's performance were identical to the performance in the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year.
  \item
    Notwithstanding Section 3(d)(1) above, in the event that, at the time of the signing of a Contract, Renegotiation or Extension, the NBA or the Players Association believes that the performance of a player and/or his Team during the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year does not fairly predict the likelihood of the player earning a Performance Bonus during any Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract, Renegotiation or extended term of the Extension (as the case may be), the NBA or the Players Association may request that a jointly selected basketball expert (``Expert'') determine whether (i) in the case of an NBA challenge, it is very likely that the bonus will be earned, or (ii) in the case of a Players Association challenge, it is very likely that the bonus will not be earned. The party initiating a proceeding before the Expert shall carry the burden of proof. The Expert shall conduct a hearing within five (5) business days after the initiation of the proceeding, and shall render a determination within five (5) business days after the hearing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(d)(2), no party may, in connection with any proceeding before the Expert, refer to the facts that, absent a challenge pursuant to this Section 3(d)(2), a Performance Bonus would or would not be included in a player's Salary pursuant to Section 3(d)(1) above, or would be termed ``Likely'' or ``Unlikely'' pursuant to Article I, Section 1(dd) or (sss). If, following an NBA challenge, the Expert determines that a Performance Bonus is very likely to be earned, the bonus shall be included in the player's Salary. If, following a Players Association challenge, the Expert determines that a Performance Bonus is very likely not to be earned, the bonus shall be excluded from the player's Salary. The Expert's determination that a Performance Bonus is very likely to be earned or very likely not to be earned shall be final, binding and unappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection with any proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 3(d)(2) shall be borne equally by the parties.
  \item
    In the case of a Rookie or a Veteran who did not play during the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year who signs a Contract containing a Performance Bonus, or in the case of a player signed or acquired by an Expansion Team whose Contract contains a Performance Bonus to be paid as a result of, in whole or in part, the player's achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to the Team's performance during its first Salary Cap Year, such Performance Bonus will be included in Salary if it is likely to be earned. In the event that the NBA and the Players Association cannot agree as to whether a Performance Bonus is likely to be earned, such dispute will be referred to the Expert, who will determine whether the bonus is likely to be earned or not likely to be earned. The Expert shall conduct a hearing within five (5) business days after the initiation of the proceeding, and shall render a determination within five (5) business days after the hearing. The Expert's determination that a Performance Bonus is likely to be earned or not likely to be earned shall be final, binding and unappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection with any proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 3(d)(3) shall be borne equally by the parties.
  \item
    In the event that either party initiates a proceeding pursuant to Section 3(d)(2) or (3) above, the player's Salary plus the full amount of any disputed bonuses shall be included in Team Salary during the pendency of the proceeding.
  \item
    In the event the NBA and the Players Association cannot agree on an Expert, any challenge pursuant to Section 3(d)(2) and (3) above may be filed with the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with Article XXXI, Sections 2-7 and 15.
  \item
    All Incentive Compensation described in Article II, Sections 3(b)(iii) and 3(c) shall be included in Salary.

    Subject to Article XIII, any payment up to the Excluded International Player Payment Amount for a Salary Cap Year paid by or at the direction of any NBA Team pursuant to Section 3(e)(1) above to a professional basketball team outside the United States to secure the contractual release of a player shall not be deemed Salary to the player.
  \item
    The Excluded International Player Payment Amount may be paid in a single installment or in multiple installments. The Excluded International Player Payment Amount, whether used in whole or in part, may be used by an NBA Team whenever it signs a player to a new Player Contract, except that the Excluded International Player Payment Amount may not be used, in whole or in part, more than once in any three-Season period with respect to the same player.
  \item
    The Excluded International Player Payment Amount, or any part of it, shall be deemed to have been used as of the date of the Player Contract to which it applies, regardless of when it is actually paid. A schedule of payments relating to the Excluded International Player Payment Amount, or any part of it, agreed upon at the time of the signing of the Player Contract to which it applies, shall not be deemed a multiple use of the Excluded International Player Payment Amount.
  \item
    Notwithstanding Section 3(e)(1) above, no amount paid or to be paid pursuant to this Section 3(e) shall be counted toward the Minimum Team Salary obligation of a Team in accordance with Section 2(b) or (c) above.
  \item
    Within two (2) business days following the NBA's receipt of notice of any payments made by any NBA Team that are governed by this Section 3(e), the NBA shall provide the Players Association with written notice of such payments.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{One-Year Minimum Contracts.} Except where otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Salary of every player who signs a one-year, 10-Day or Rest-of-Season Contract for the Minimum Player Salary applicable to such player shall be the lesser of (1) such Minimum Player Salary, or (2) the portion of such Minimum Player Salary that is not reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits fund described in Article IV, Section 6(k)(2).
\item
  \textbf{Insurance Premium Reimbursement.} If a Team reimburses a player for life insurance premiums pursuant to Article II, Section 4(j)(ii), such premium reimbursement shall not be included in the computation of the player's Salary.
\item
  \textbf{Averaging.} In accordance with Article XI, Section 5(c)(iii), a player's Salary for each Salary Cap Year covered by his Contract shall be deemed in certain circumstances to be the average of the aggregate Salaries for each such Salary Cap Year.
\item
  \textbf{Existing Contracts.} A player's Salary with respect to any Salary Cap Year covered by a Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement shall continue to be calculated in accordance with the Salary Cap rules that were in existence at the time the Contract was entered into. In no event shall the preceding sentence apply to the calculation of Salary with respect to any Contract, Extension, Renegotiation, transaction, or event entered into or occurring on or after the date of this Agreement.

    Subject to the rules set forth in this Article VII (including, without limitation, the amnesty rules set forth in Section 12(f)(5) and 12(j) below), the aggregate Salaries of all active players (and former players to the extent provided by the terms of this Agreement) attributable to a particular Salary Cap Year, including, without limitation:

      Salaries paid or to be paid to players whose Player Contracts have been terminated pursuant to the NBA's waiver procedure (without regard to any revised payment schedule that might be provided for in the terminated Player Contracts), except that, with respect to any Player Contract entered into or extended after the date of this Agreement that has been terminated pursuant to the NBA's waiver procedure, if the waiving Team elects in writing to have the player's Salary stretched in accordance with Section 7(d)(5) below, then the amount to be included in Team Salary for a Salary Cap Year in respect of the terminated Player Contract shall equal the ``Stretched Salary Amounts'' as calculated in accordance with Section 7(d)(5) below.
    \item
      Any amount called for in a retired player's Player Contract paid or to be paid to the player. When a player retires and the Team continues to pay such amounts, then, for purposes of computing the player's Salary for the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract, the aggregate of such amounts, notwithstanding the payment schedule, shall be allocated pro rata over the then-current and each remaining Salary Cap Year on the basis of the remaining unearned protected Compensation in each such Salary Cap Year at the time of retirement.
    \item
      Amounts paid or to be paid pursuant to awards for, or settlements of, grievances between a player and a Team concerning Compensation obligations under a Player Contract in accordance with the following rules (which, except for purposes of Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(D) below, shall be applied with respect to each Season for which there is any Compensation in dispute, as if the grievance relates only to such Season):

          When a player initiates a Grievance (as defined in Article XXXI) against a Team seeking the payment of Compensation for a Season covered by the current or any future Salary Cap Year that the Team asserts is not owed, fifty percent (50\%) of the disputed amount shall be included in Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year to which the grievance relates. If the Grievance is resolved during or prior to the Salary Cap Year to which it relates, following resolution of the Grievance, whether by award or settlement, the disputed amount payable by the Team in excess of the fifty percent (50\%) allocation shall be included in Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year to which the Grievance relates, or, alternatively, the amount by which the fifty percent (50\%) allocation exceeds the disputed amount payable by the Team shall be subtracted from Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year to which the Grievance relates.
        \item
          If a Grievance described in the first sentence of Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(1) above is resolved after the conclusion of the Salary Cap Year to which it relates, the disputed amount payable by the Team related to such Salary Cap Year in excess of the fifty percent (50\%) allocation shall be included in Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which the Grievance is resolved, or, alternatively, the amount by which the fifty percent (50\%) allocation exceeds the disputed amount payable by the Team related to such Salary Cap Year shall be subtracted from Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which the grievance is resolved. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Team shall be required to pay additional tax to the NBA if and to the extent that, due to the operation of this Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(2), the aggregate tax it pays to the NBA pursuant to Section 12(f) below for the two (2) Salary Cap Years in question (the Salary Cap Year for which the fifty percent (50\%) allocation was made and the subsequent Salary Cap Year in which the Grievance was resolved) is less than it would have been had the Grievance been resolved during the Salary Cap Year to which it related; a Team shall be entitled to a tax refund from the NBA if and to the extent that, due to the operation of this Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(2), the aggregate tax it pays to the NBA pursuant to Section 12(f) below for the two (2) Salary Cap Years in question is greater than it would have been had the grievance been resolved during the Salary Cap Year to which it related. In order to facilitate any such required tax refund from the NBA to the Team, the NBA shall set aside, pending resolution of the Grievance, the amount of tax paid by that Team in the Salary Cap Year to which the Grievance relates that is attributable to the fifty percent (50\%) allocation. Following resolution of the Grievance, the NBA shall pay to the Team the tax refund to which it is entitled (if any) based upon the resolution of the Grievance, and the remainder of the set aside tax funds shall be distributed by the NBA to one (1) or more Teams or otherwise used by the League in such manner as the NBA may reasonably determine, consistent with the provisions of Section 12(g) below.
        \end{enumerate}
      \item
        When a player initiates a Grievance against a Team seeking the payment of Compensation for a Season covered by a prior Salary Cap Year that the Team asserts is not owed, following resolution of the Grievance, whether by award or settlement, the disputed amount payable by the Team, if any, shall be included in Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which the Grievance is resolved (but only to the extent that it had been previously excluded from Team Salary). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Team shall be required to pay additional tax to the NBA if and to the extent that, due to the operation of this Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(B), the aggregate tax it pays to the NBA pursuant to Section 12(f) below for the two (2) Salary Cap Years in question (the Salary Cap Year to which the Grievance related and the subsequent Salary Cap Year in which the Grievance was resolved) is less than it would have been had the disputed amount payable by the Team been included in Team Salary during the Salary Cap Year to which it related; a Team shall be entitled to a tax refund from the NBA if and to the extent that, due to the operation of this Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(B), the aggregate tax it pays to the NBA pursuant to Section 12(f) below for the two (2) Salary Cap Years in question is greater than it would have been had the disputed amount payable by the Team been included in Team Salary during the Salary Cap Year to which it related. In order to facilitate any such required tax refund from the NBA to the Team, the NBA shall set aside, pending resolution of the Grievance, the amount of tax paid by that Team in the Salary Cap Year to which the Grievance relates that is attributable to the fifty percent (50\%) allocation. Following resolution of the Grievance, the NBA shall pay to the Team the tax refund to which it is entitled (if any) based upon the resolution of the Grievance, and the remainder of the set aside tax funds shall be distributed by the NBA to one (1) or more Teams or otherwise used by the League in such manner as the NBA may reasonably determine, consistent with the provisions of Section 12(g) below.
      \item
        If a Grievance relates to a player's Compensation for more than one (1) Season, for purposes of determining the disputed amount payable by the Team with respect to each such Season following the resolution of the Grievance, the aggregate amounts payable to the player for all Seasons pursuant to the resolution of the grievance, whether by award or settlement, shall be allocated to each such Season in proportion to the amount of Compensation that was in dispute for such Season, unless, in the case of an award, the Grievance Arbitrator allocates the amounts payable to the player to specific Seasons.(D) Immediately upon reaching any agreement (oral or written) to resolve a Grievance relating to a player's Compensation, a Team shall notify the NBA by facsimile or email and provide the NBA with the terms of such agreement. A Team's failure to comply with the preceding sentence may be considered evidence of a violation of Article XIII. If a Team delays or attempts to delay in any manner the processing or resolution of a Grievance relating to a player's Compensation for the purpose of creating or increasing its Room in any Salary Cap Year or for the purpose of reducing or deferring a tax payment to the NBA, such conduct shall constitute a violation of Article XIII.

If, after such following July 1, or any subsequent July 1, the player signs another, or remains under, contract with a non-NBA team, the player's applicable Rookie Scale Amount will again be excluded from Team Salary beginning on the date of the contract signing or the first day of the Regular Season commencing after such July 1, whichever is later, and will again be included in Team Salary at the applicable Rookie Scale Amount on the following July 1 or the date the player's contract ends (or the player is released from his non-NBA contractual obligations), whichever is earlier, unless the Team renounces its exclusive rights to the player in accordance with Article X, Section 4(f).
  \item
    A Team that holds draft rights to a First Round Pick may elect to have the player's applicable Rookie Scale Amount excluded from its Team Salary at any time prior to the first day of any Regular Season by providing the NBA with a written statement that the Team will not sign the player during that Salary Cap Year accompanied by a written statement from the First Round Pick renouncing his right to accept any outstanding Required Tender made to him by the Team. After making such an election, (i) the Team shall be prohibited from signing the player during that Salary Cap Year, except in accordance with Section 5(e)(4)(ii) below, (ii) the Team shall continue to possess such rights with respect to the player that the Team possessed pursuant to Article X immediately prior to such election, and (iii) the player's applicable Rookie Scale Amount shall be included again in his Team's Team Salary at the applicable Rookie Scale Amount on the following July 1. When a First Round Pick provides a Team with a written statement renouncing his right to accept that year's outstanding Required Tender, the Player shall no longer be permitted to accept it.
  \item
    For purposes of this Section 4(e), in the event that a First Round Pick does not sign a Contract with the Team that holds his draft rights during the Salary Cap Year immediately following the Draft in which he was selected (or during the same Salary Cap Year in which he was drafted if the Draft occurs on or after July 1), the ``applicable Rookie Scale Amount'' for such First Round Pick means, with respect to any subsequent Salary Cap Year, the Rookie Scale Amount that would apply if the player were drafted in the Draft immediately preceding such Salary Cap Year at the same draft position at which he was actually selected.

  \item
    If at any time from July 1 through the day prior to the first day of the Regular Season a Team has fewer than twelve (12) players, determined in accordance with Section 4(f)(2) below, included in its Team Salary, then the Team's Team Salary shall be increased by an amount calculated as follows:\\
    STEP 1: Subtract from twelve (12) the number of players included in Team Salary.\\
    STEP 2: If the result in Step 1 is a positive number, multiply the result in Step 1 by the Minimum Annual Salary applicable to players with zero (0) Years of Service for that Salary Cap Year.
  \item
    In determining whether a Team has fewer than twelve (12) players included in its Team Salary for purposes of Section 4(f)(1) above only, the only players who shall be counted are (i) players under Contract with the Team who are included in Team Salary, (ii) Free Agents who are included in Team Salary pursuant to Section 4 (a)(2) above, (iii) players to whom Offer Sheets have been given, and (iv) unsigned First Round Picks who are included in Team Salary pursuant to Section 4(e) above.

  \textbf{Renouncing.}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To renounce a Veteran Free Agent, a Team must provide the NBA with a written statement renouncing its right to re-sign the player, effective no earlier than the July 1 following the last Season covered by the player's Contract. (The NBA shall notify the Players Association of any such renunciation by fax or email within two (2) business days following receipt of notice of such renunciation.) If a Team renounces a Veteran Free Agent, the player will no longer qualify as a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, as the case may be, and the Team will only be permitted to re-sign such player with Room (i.e., the Team cannot sign such player pursuant to Section 6(b) below) or pursuant to the Minimum Player Salary Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Team renounces one or more players in order to create Room for an Offer Sheet, and the offeree-player's Prior Team subsequently matches the Offer Sheet and enters into a Contract with that player, the Team may rescind the renunciation(s) within two (2) business days of the date the Offer Sheet is matched, whereupon any such ``unrenounced'' player may again sign a Player Contract with the Team as a First Round Pick, Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, as the case may be, and will again be included in his Prior Team's Team Salary at his applicable Free Agent Amount; provided, however, that a Team may not rescind the renunciation of a player if (i) at the time the player was renounced the Team's Team Salary was at or below the Salary Cap and ``unrenouncing'' the player would cause the Team's Team Salary to exceed the Salary Cap, or (ii) at the time the player was renounced the Team's Team Salary was above the Salary Cap and ``unrenouncing'' the player would cause the Team's Team Salary to exceed the Salary Cap by more than the amount by which the Team's Team Salary exceeded the Salary Cap prior to the renunciation.
  \item
    A Team cannot renounce any player to whom the Team has made a Qualifying Offer until such time as the Qualifying Offer is no longer in effect.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Long-Term Injuries.} Any player who suffers a career-ending injury or illness, and whose contract is terminated by the Team in accordance with the NBA waiver procedure, will be excluded from his Team's Team Salary as follows:

  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Subject to Section 4(h)(5) below, beginning on the first anniversary of the date of the last NBA Regular Season or playoff game in which the player played, the Team may apply to the NBA to have the player's Salary for each remaining Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract excluded from Team Salary (i) if the player played in ten (10) or more NBA Regular Season and playoff games in a Season, on the first anniversary of the date during such Season in which the player last played in a NBA Regular Season or playoff game, (ii) if the player played in less than ten (10) NBA Regular Season and playoff games in a Season, on the later of (A) sixty (60) days following the date during such Season in which the player last played in a NBA Regular Season or playoff game, and (B) the first anniversary of the date during a prior NBA Season in which the player last played in a NBA Regular Season or playoff game.
  \item
    The determination of whether a player has suffered a career-ending injury or illness shall be made by a physician selected jointly by the NBA and the Players Association. A player shall be deemed to have suffered a career-ending injury or illness if it is determined that the player has an injury or illness that (i) prevents him from playing skilled professional basketball at an NBA level for the duration of his career, or (ii) substantially impairs his ability to play skilled professional basketball at an NBA level and is of such severity that continuing to play professional basketball at an NBA level would subject the player to medically unacceptable risk of suffering a life-threatening or permanently disabling injury or illness.
  \item
    Notwithstanding Section 4(h)(1) and (2) above, if after a player's Salary is excluded from Team Salary in accordance with this Section 4(h), the player plays in twenty-five (25) NBA Regular Season and playoff games in any Season for any Team, the excluded Salary for the Salary Cap Year covering such Season and each subsequent Salary Cap Year shall thereupon be included in Team Salary of the Team from which the Salary was previously excluded (and if the twenty-fifth game played is a playoff game, then the excluded Salary shall be included in Team Salary retroactively as of the start of the Team's last Regular Season game). After a player's Salary for one (1) or more Salary Cap Years has been included in Team Salary in accordance with this Section 4(h)(3), the Team shall be permitted to re-apply to have the player's Salary (for each Salary Cap Year remaining at the time of the re-application) excluded from Team Salary in accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 4(h) (including the waiting period criteria set forth in Section 4(h)(1) above).
  \item
    If a Team applies to have a player's Salary excluded from its Team Salary pursuant to this Section 4(h), the player shall cooperate in the processing of the application, including by appearing at the reasonably scheduled place and time for examination by the jointly-selected physician. The player shall not make any misrepresentation or fail to disclose any relevant information in connection with the processing of the application.
  \item
    Only the Team with which the player was under Contract at the time his career-ending injury or illness became known or reasonably should have become known shall be permitted to apply to have the player's Salary excluded from Team Salary pursuant to this Section 4(h).
  \item
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if a Team applies to have a player's Salary excluded from its Team Salary pursuant to this Section 4(h) and such application is granted, the Team will be prohibited from re-signing or re-acquiring that player at any time, and (ii) if a Team makes a request for an Exception to replace a Disabled Player pursuant to Section 6(c) below for a Salary Cap Year, then, whether such application is granted or denied, the Team will be precluded from applying to have that player's Salary excluded from its Team Salary pursuant to this Section 4(h) for the same Salary Cap Year.

Except as set forth in the following sentence, no Summer Contract may provide for (i) Compensation of any kind that is or may be paid or earned prior to the first day of the next Regular Season, or (ii) Compensation protection of any kind pursuant to Article II, Section 3(e) or 4. The only consideration that may be provided to a player signed to a Summer Contract, prior to the start of the Regular Season, is per diem, lodging, transportation, compensation in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of the Uniform Player Contract, and a disability insurance policy covering disabilities incurred while such player participates in summer leagues or rookie camps for the Team. A Team that has entered into one or more Summer Contracts must terminate such Contracts no later than the day prior to the first day of a Regular Season, except to the extent the Team has Room for such Contracts.
  \item
    A Team may not enter into a Summer Contract with a Veteran Free Agent who last played for the Team unless the Contract is for one (1) Season only and provides for no more than the Minimum Player Salary applicable to such player.

  \textbf{Disabled Player Exception.}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}

  \item
    Subject to the rules set forth in Section 6(m) below, a Team may, in accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 6(c), sign or acquire one Replacement Player to replace a player who, as a result of a Disabling Injury or Illness (as defined below), is unable to render playing services (the ``Disabled Player'').

      If a Team wishes to sign a Replacement Player pursuant to this Section 6(c), such Replacement Player's Contract may be for one Season and provide Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the Salary Cap Year in which the player is signed totaling up to the lesser of (A) fifty percent (50\%) of the Disabled Player's Salary for the then-current Salary Cap Year, or (B) an amount equal to Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception (as defined in Section 6(e) below) for such Salary Cap Year.
    \item
      If a Team wishes to acquire a Replacement Player pursuant to this Section 6(c), the Replacement Player must have only one Season remaining on his Player Contract and the Replacement Player's post-assignment Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which the Replacement Player is acquired may be up to the lesser of the amount described in Section 6(c)(1)(ii)(A) above or the amount described in Section 6(c)(1)(ii)(B) above, plus, in either case, \$100,000.

    For purposes of this Section 6(c), Disabling Injury or Illness means any injury or illness that, in the opinion of the physician described in Section 6(c)(4) below, makes it substantially more likely than not that the player would be unable to play through the following June 15.
  \item
    The Exception for a Disabling Injury or Illness shall expire on the March 10 following the date the Exception is granted.
  \item
    The determination of whether a player has suffered a Disabling Injury or Illness shall be made by a physician designated by the NBA, who shall review the relevant medical information and, if the physician deems it appropriate, examine the player. The NBA shall advise the Players Association of the determination of its physician within one (1) business day of such determination. In the event the Players Association disputes the NBA physician's determination, the parties will immediately refer the matter to a neutral physician (to be selected by the parties at the commencement of each Salary Cap Year) to review the relevant medical information and, if the neutral physician deems it appropriate, examine the player. Within three (3) business days of receipt of such information (and examination of the player, if requested), the neutral physician shall make a final determination, which will be final, binding and unappealable. The cost of the NBA physician will be borne by the NBA. The cost of the neutral physician will be borne equally and jointly by the NBA and the Players Association.
  \item
    If a Team requests an Exception pursuant to this Section 6(c), the player with respect to whom the request is made shall cooperate in the processing of the request, including by appearing at the scheduled place and time for examination by the NBA-appointed physician and, if necessary, the neutral physician. The player shall not make any misrepresentation or fail to disclose any relevant information in connection with the processing of the application.
  \item
    Notwithstanding a Team's receipt of an Exception in respect of a Disabled Player pursuant to this Section 6(c), such player, upon recovering from his injury or illness, may resume playing for the Team. If the player resumes playing for the Team, or is traded, prior to the Team's use of its Exception, the Exception shall be extinguished.
  \item
    The Disabled Player Exception is available only to the Team with which the player was under Contract at the time his Disabling Injury or Illness became known or reasonably should have become known.
  \item
    If a Team makes a request for an Exception to replace a Disabled Player pursuant to this Section 6(c) and such request is denied, the Team shall not be permitted to make any subsequent request for an Exception to replace the same player pursuant to this Section 6(c) unless ninety (90) days have passed since the first request was denied and the Team establishes that the subsequent request is based on a new injury or an aggravation of the same injury. If a Team makes a request for an Exception to replace a Disabled Player for a Season pursuant to this Section 6(c), then, whether such request is granted or denied, the Team shall be permitted to renew its request for an Exception to replace the Disabled Player for a subsequent Season(s) by applying for another Exception in respect of that player for such Season in accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 6(c).

During each Salary Cap Year in which a Team is permitted to use the Bi-annual Exception, a Team may sign one (1) or more Player Contracts, not to exceed two (2) Seasons in length, that, in the aggregate, provide for Salaries and Unlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year totaling up to the amounts set forth below:

A Team may at any time renounce its rights to use an Exception, in which case the Exception (or any unused portion of the Exception) will no longer be included in Team Salary.
  \item
    For purposes of Section 6(d), Section 6(e), Section 6(f) and Section 8(e) below, a Team's Team Salary for any Salary Cap Year shall be adjusted as follows:

      Team Salary shall exclude the amount of any Salary Cap Exception that is deemed included in Team Salary pursuant to Sections 4(a)(7) and 6(m)(2) above.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a player is a Veteran Free Agent whose last Contract was a Rookie Scale Contract and whose Prior Team did not exercise the first Option Year to extend such Contract for a third Season or whose Prior Team did not exercise its second Option Year to extend such Contract for a fourth Season, then any new Player Contract that the player and Team with whom the player was under his Rookie Scale Contract enter into may provide for Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year of up to the Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, that the player would have received for such Salary Cap Year had his Prior Team exercised its first or second Option Year (as applicable). Annual increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by Section 5(c)(2) above.
  \item
    Beginning on January 10 of each Season, each unused Exception, other than the Traded Player Exception, the Minimum Player Salary Exception (which is governed by Section 6(i) above and Article I, Section (ii)) and the Disabled Player Exception, shall be reduced daily throughout the end of the Regular Season by the product of the amount of the unused Exception as of January 10 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such Regular Season.

In the event that the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original term of the Contract provides for Incentive Compensation, the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term may provide for Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses of up to one hundred seven and one-half percent (107.5\% of the Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, in the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original term. Annual increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by Section 5(c)(3) above, except that, for purposes of only clause (ii) of this Section 7(a)(4), the phrase ``Regular Salary'' in Section 5(c)(3) above shall be deemed to mean the greater of (A) the average of the Regular Salaries for each Salary Cap Year covered by the original Contract beginning with the Salary Cap Year in which such Contract was entered into, or previously extended, as the case may be, or (B) the Regular Salary in the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original Contract.

    A First Round Pick who enters into a Rookie Scale Contract may enter into an Extension of such Rookie Scale Contract during the period from the day following the last day of the Moratorium Period through October 31 of the second Option Year provided for in such Contract (assuming the Team exercises such Option).
  \item
    An Extension of a Rookie Scale Contract may provide for Salary and Unlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term totaling no more than the maximum amount provided for in Article II, Section 7. Annual increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by Section 5(c)(4) above.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Renegotiations.} No Player Contract may be renegotiated except in accordance with the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Subject to Section 7(c)(2) and (3) below, a Player Contract covering a term of four (4) or more Seasons may be renegotiated no sooner than the third anniversary of the signing of the Contract.
  \item
    Subject to Section 7(c)(3) below, any Player Contract that has been renegotiated in accordance with Section 7(c)(1) above to provide for an increase in Salary or Incentive Compensation in any Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract of more than four and one-half percent (4.5\%), or extended in accordance with Section 7(a) or (b) above, may not subsequently be renegotiated until the third anniversary of the signing of such Extension or Renegotiation.
  \item
    Assuming Section 7(c) (1) or (2) above are satisfied, a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may renegotiate a Player Contract in accordance with the following rules:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Subject to Article II, Section 7, the Renegotiation may provide for additional Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses and/or Unlikely Bonuses for the then-current Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract (the ``Renegotiation Season'') that, in the aggregate, would not exceed the Team's Room at the time of the Renegotiation.
    \item
      Every category (Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively) that is increased for the Renegotiation Season must also be increased for each of the remaining Seasons of the Contract. For each Season of the Contract after the Renegotiation Season, the player's additional Regular Salary may increase or decrease over the previous Season's additional Regular Salary by no more than seven and one-half percent (7.5\%) of the additional Regular Salary provided for in the Renegotiation Season. In the event that the Renegotiation Season provides for additional Incentive Compensation, the amount of additional Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses provided for in each Season after the Renegotiation Season may increase or decrease by up to seven and one-half percent (7.5\%) of the amount of additional Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, provided for in the Renegotiation Season.
    \item
      No Renegotiation may contain a signing bonus, unless the Renegotiation is accompanied by an Extension and the signing bonus would otherwise be permitted under the rules governing the inclusion of signing bonuses in Extensions.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    In no event may a Team with a Team Salary at or above the Salary Cap renegotiate a Player Contract.
  \item
    In no event may a Team and a player renegotiate a Player Contract from March 1 through June 30 of any Salary Cap Year.

    In no event shall a Team and player negotiate a decrease in Salary or in any Incentive Compensation for any Salary Cap Year covered by a Player Contract.
  \item
    A Player Contract that is extended pursuant to Section 7(a) above may be renegotiated simultaneously, but only if and to the extent permitted by the rules set forth in Section 7(c) above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a Player Contract is extended pursuant to Section 7(a) above and renegotiated simultaneously, then the amount of the player's Salary, excluding Incentive Compensation, in the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term may decrease by no more than forty percent (40\%) of the player's Regular Salary (as renegotiated) in the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original term. In the event that the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original term provides for Incentive Compensation, the amount of Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term may decrease by up to forty percent (40\%) of the player's Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively (as renegotiated), in the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original term.
  \item
    For the sole purpose of enabling an assignee Team to acquire a Player Contract by trade, the player and the assignor Team may agree to waive all or any portion of a trade bonus, but only to the extent necessary to make the trade permissible in accordance with the rules set forth in Section 6(j) above. Thus, for example, a trade will be considered permissible if the Team has a pre-existing Traded Player Exception that could be used to make the trade work in accordance with the rules set forth in Section 6(j). In the event that, in connection with a trade, a player's Contract is amended in accordance with this Section 7(d)(3), such Contract may not be subsequently extended or renegotiated until the later of (i) six (6) months from the date of the trade, or (ii) the first date on which the Contract could otherwise be extended or renegotiated pursuant to this Section 7.
  \item
    In the event that a Team and a player agree to amend a Player Contract in accordance with Article II, Section 3(l), then for purposes of calculating the player's Salary for the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract, notwithstanding any stretch or acceleration of the player's protected Compensation payment schedule, the aggregate reduction in the player's protected Compensation shall be allocated pro rata over the then-current and each remaining Salary Cap Year on the basis of the remaining unearned protected Base Compensation in each such Salary Cap Year.
  \item
    In the event that a Team terminates a Player Contract that was entered into or extended on or after the date of this Agreement and the payment of the player's protected Compensation for one or more Seasons is stretched in accordance with Article II, Section 4(k), then the waiving Team may elect to have the player's Salary for the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Years stretched (i.e., re-attributed) for purposes of calculating the Team's Team Salary as follows (``Stretched Salary Amounts''):

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\Alph{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      in the event a request for waivers on the player is made during the period from September 1 through the following June 30, (i) the player's post-termination Salary for the then-current Salary Cap Year (after giving effect to the provisions of Section (d)(4) above, if applicable) shall remain unchanged, and (ii) the player's post-termination Salary for each remaining Salary Cap Year (after giving effect to the provisions of Section (d)(4) above, if applicable) shall be aggregated and allocated evenly over a number of Salary Cap Years equal to twice the number of Seasons (including any Player Option Year) remaining on the Contract following the Salary Cap Year in which the request for waivers occurred (not including the then-current Season or, in the case of requests for waivers made from September 1 through the first day of a Regular Season, the upcoming Season), plus one (1) Season; or
    \item
      in the event a request for waivers on the player is made during the period from July 1 through August 31, the player's post-termination Salary for the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Years (after giving effect to the provisions of Section (d)(4) above, if applicable) shall be aggregated and allocated evenly over a number of Salary Cap Years equal to twice the number of Seasons (including any Player Option Year) remaining on the Contract following the date of the request for waivers (including the upcoming Season), plus one (1) Season;
    \end{enumerate}

    With respect to Player Contracts extended on or after the date of this Agreement, the foregoing Salary re-attribution shall apply only with respect to the extended term of the Player Contract. To make an election pursuant to this Section (d)(5), a Team must, within one (1) business day following the termination of the Contract, provide the NBA with a written statement electing to stretch the player's Salary (and the NBA shall provide notice of such election to the Players Association by facsimile or email within two (2) business days). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall a Team be permitted to elect to stretch a waived player's Salary if the portion of the Team's Team Salary representing all of the Team's waived players (and any other former players) in any future Salary Cap Year exceeds or as a result of the proposed stretch would exceed fifteen percent (15\%) of the Salary Cap in effect during the Salary Cap Year in which the player is waived.
  \item
    In no event shall a Team and player amend a Contract for the purpose of terminating or shortening the term of the Contract, except in accordance with the NBA waiver procedure or Article XII, Section 2.

  For purposes of this Section 8(a), (i) if a Contract is signed and then traded pursuant to Section 8(e)(1) below, and the Contract contains a signing bonus, the payment of all or any portion of such bonus by the Team that signed the Contract shall be treated as a reimbursement of a Compensation obligation of the assignee Team and shall be subject to this Section 8(a), and (ii) the amounts paid or received by a Team in connection with one (1) or more trades occurring during a Salary Cap Year shall not be netted against each other (thus, for example, if Team A pays \$3 million in connection with one (1) trade occurring during the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year and receives \$3 million from another Team in connection with either the same or a subsequent trade occurring during the same Salary Cap Year, Team A would be unable to either pay or receive any cash in connection with any subsequent trades that it makes during that Salary Cap Year).
\item
  A player with a one-year Contract (excluding any Option Year) who would be a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or an Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent upon completing the playing services called for under his Contract cannot be traded without the player's consent. Should the player consent and be traded, then, for purposes of determining whether the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent at the conclusion of the Contract or any subsequent Contract between the player and the assignee Team, the player shall be considered as having changed Teams by means of signing a Contract with the assignee Team as a Free Agent (and not by means of trade).
\item
  A Team cannot trade any player after the NBA trade deadline occurring in the last Season of the player's Contract, or after the NBA trade deadline occurring in any Season that could be the last Season of the player's Contract based upon the exercise or non-exercise of an Option or Early Termination Option.

    No Draft Rookie who signs a Player Contract may be traded before thirty (30) days following the date on which the Contract is signed.
  \item
    No player who signs a Contract as a Free Agent may be traded before the later of (A) three (3) months following the date on which such Contract was signed or (B) the December 15 of the Salary Cap Year in which such Contract was signed; provided, that if a Contract is signed in connection with an agreement to trade the Contract in accordance with Section 8(e) below, the foregoing rule shall not apply to the initial trade but shall instead be applicable if the Contract is traded a second time.
  \item
    Notwithstanding the rule set forth in Section (d)(ii) above, any player who signs a Contract with his prior Team meeting the following criteria may not be traded before the later of (x) three (3) months following the date on which such Contract was signed or (y) the January 15 of the Salary Cap Year in which such Contract was signed: the Team Salary of the player's Team is at or above the Salary Cap and the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent who, in accordance with Section 6(b)(1) or (3) above, enters into a new Player Contract with his prior Team that provides for a Salary for the first Season of such new Contract greater than one hundred twenty percent (120\%) of the Salary for the last Season of the player's immediately prior Contract. The rule set forth in this Section (d)(iii) shall not apply to a player if his new Contract provides for Salary equal to the Minimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, if the player's immediately prior Contract was a one-year Contract that provided for Salary equal to the Minimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind), the player's prior Salary shall include the portion of the Minimum Player Salary, if any, that was reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits fund described in Article IV, Section 6(k).

    A Veteran Free Agent and his Prior Team may enter into a Player Contract pursuant to an agreement between the Prior Team and another Team concerning the signing and subsequent trade of such Contract, but only if (i) the Veteran Free Agent finished the prior Season on his Prior Team's roster, (ii) the Contract is for at least three (3) Seasons (excluding any Option Year) but no more than four (4) Seasons in length, (iii) the Contract is not signed pursuant to the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception, the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception or the Disabled Player Exception, (iv) the first Season of the Contract is fully protected for lack of skill, (v) the Contract is entered into prior to the first day of the Regular Season, (vi) with respect to any 5th Year Eligible Player (as defined in Article II, Section 7) who met one of the 5th Year 30\% Max Criteria (as defined in Article II, Section 7), the Contract may not provide the player with Salary (plus Unlikely Bonuses) in excess of twenty-five percent (25\%) of the Salary Cap (as calculated pursuant to Article II, Section 7) in effect at the time the Contract is signed, and (vii) the acquiring Team has Room for the player's Salary plus any Unlikely Bonuses provided for in the first Season of the Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence, commencing with the 2013-14 Salary Cap Year, a Team shall not be permitted to acquire a player pursuant to a Contract entered into in accordance with this Section 8(e)(1) if the Team's Team Salary following the proposed transaction would exceed the Tax Level for such Salary Cap Year plus \$4 million, and if a Team acquires a player pursuant to this Section 8(e)(1), then the Team's Team Salary at all times thereafter during the Salary Cap Year may not exceed the Tax Level for such Salary Cap Year plus \$4 million.
  \item
    A player and his Team may amend a Player Contract (including by entering into an Extension but not by entering into a Renegotiation) pursuant to an agreement between such Team and another Team concerning the signing of the amendment and subsequent trade of the amended Contract; provided, however, that: (i) no such agreement may be made during the period from the last day of the last Regular Season covered by the Contract (or the last day of any Regular Season that could be the last Regular Season covered by the Contract based upon the exercise or non-exercise of an Option or ETO) through the following June 30; and (ii) no such Extension entered into pursuant to this Section 8(e)(2) may cover more than three (3) Seasons from the date the Extension is signed. The Salary and Unlikely Bonuses that may be provided in the first year of the extended term and annual increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by Section 7(a)(3)(ii) and Section 5(c)(5) above.
  \item
    A Player Contract or Extension entered into pursuant to Section 8(e)(1) or (2) above may not contain an Exhibit 6 thereto. However, the preceding sentence shall not prohibit the Teams involved in the trade from agreeing that the trade (and thus the validity of the Player Contract or Extension) will be conditional upon the passage of a physical examination to be performed by a physician designated by the assignee-Team in accordance with NBA procedures.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  In the event a player enters into an Extension pursuant to Section 7(a) above that covers four (4) Seasons and/or provides for Salary and Unlikely Bonuses or annual increases in the player's Salary and Unlikely Bonuses in excess of the amounts permissible in connection with Extensions entered in connection with an agreement to trade the Contract pursuant to Section 8(e)(2) above, the player may not be traded before six (6) months following the date on which such Extension was signed. If a team acquires a player in a trade, then, for a period of six (6) months following the date of the trade, the team may not enter into an Extension with the player that provides for four (4) Seasons and/or provides for Salary and Unlikely Bonuses or annual increases in the player's Salary and Unlikely Bonuses in excess of the amounts permissible in connection with Extensions entered in connection with an agreement to trade the Contract pursuant to Section 8(e)(2) above.
\item
  In the event a Rookie Scale Contract is extended pursuant to Section 7(b) above and a Team proposes to trade such Contract to another Team prior to the July 1 immediately following such extension, then, only for purposes of determining whether the acquiring Team has Room for the Contract, the Salary for the last Season of the original term of the Contract shall be deemed to equal the average of the aggregate Salaries for such Season and each Season of the extended term.
\item
  If a Team trades a player and the assignee Team subsequently places the player on waivers, the assignor Team shall not be permitted to sign the player to a new Contract (or claim the player off of waivers) before the earlier of: (i) one (1) year following the date all conditions to the trade were satisfied; or (ii) the July 1 following the last Season of the player's Player Contract.
\item
  Prior to the assignment of any Player Contract, the Team from which such Player Contract is to be assigned and the player whose Player Contract is to be assigned shall be required to divest themselves, on terms mutually agreeable to the player and the Team, of any pre-existing financial arrangements between such Team and such player. The foregoing shall not apply to Compensation earned by the player prior to the assignment or to loans.
\item
  Within one (1) week following each trade, the NBA shall send to the Players Association, by fax or email, a summary of the principal terms of the trade; provided, however, that the NBA may omit from such summary any terms that the NBA or one (1) or more Teams involved in the trade reasonably deem confidential (other than such terms as may be necessary to verify the Teams' compliance with Section 8(a) above).

    The NBA and the Players Association shall jointly engage an independent auditor (the ``Accountants'') to provide the parties with an ``Audit Report'' (and a ``Draft Audit Report,'' and, if applicable, an ``Interim Audit Report'' and, if applicable, an ``Interim Escrow Audit Report'') setting forth BRI, and Total Salaries and Benefits for the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year and the information called for by Section 12 below (the ``Escrow Information''). The audit reports provided for by this Section 10(a)(1) are to be prepared in accordance with the provisions and definitions contained in this Agreement. The engagement of the Accountants shall be deemed to be renewed annually unless they are discharged by either party during the period from the submission of an Audit Report up to January 1 of the following year. The parties agree to share equally the costs incurred by the Accountants in preparing the audit reports provided for by this Section 10(a)(1).
  \item
    The Accountants shall submit a ``Draft Audit Report'' for each Salary Cap Year to the NBA and the Players Association, along with relevant supporting documentation, two (2) weeks prior to the scheduled issuance of the final Audit Report.
  \item
    The final Audit Report shall be submitted by the Accountants to the parties on or before the last day of the Moratorium Period following the conclusion of the Salary Cap Year. The Audit Report shall not be deemed final until the parties have confirmed in writing their agreement (in a form acceptable to the parties) with such Report. The NBA, the Players Association and the Teams shall use their best efforts to facilitate the Accountants' timely completion of the Audit Report.
  \item
    In the event that, for any reason, the Accountants fail to submit to the parties a final Audit Report by the last day of the Moratorium Period, the Accountants shall prepare an interim Audit Report (the ``Interim Audit Report'') by such date setting forth the Accountants' best estimate of BRI and Total Salaries and Benefits for the preceding Salary Cap Year and, based upon such best estimates, the Escrow Information. Such Interim Audit Report shall include:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      All amounts of BRI and Total Salaries and Benefits (or the portions thereof) and all Escrow Information (or the portions thereof) for such Salary Cap Year as to which the Accountants have completed their review and, by written agreement of the Players Association and the NBA (waiving their respective rights to dispute such amounts), are not in dispute.
    \item
      With respect to any amounts of BRI or Total Salaries and Benefits (or portions thereof) as to which the Accountants have not completed their review or which are the subject of a good faith dispute between the parties, the NBA's good faith proposal as to the proper amount, if any, that should be included in the Audit Report.
    \item
      With respect to any items of Escrow Information that are the subject of a good faith dispute between the parties, the Accountants' good faith determination as to such items, taking into account the provisions of Section 10(a)(4) (i) and (ii).
    \end{enumerate}

    As soon as practicable after the Interim Audit Report is submitted to the parties, the Accountants shall submit the final Audit Report, including a description of the differences, if any, from the Interim Audit Report. The Audit Report shall not be deemed final until the parties have confirmed in writing their agreement (in a form acceptable to the parties) with such Report or all disputes with respect to such Report have been finally resolved by means of the dispute-resolution procedures provided for by this Agreement.

    If, at the conclusion of the Audit Report Challenge Period (as defined by Section 12(a)(5) below), the Accountants have not submitted or are unable to submit a final Audit Report (because, by way of example but not limitation, there are disputes or claims that have been asserted pursuant to Article XXXII, Section 9(c) and which remain pending), the Accountants shall prepare and submit to the parties, within five (5) business days following the completion of the Audit Report Challenge Period, an Interim Escrow Audit Report that shall include the information set forth in the Interim Audit Report as adjusted or amended so as to reflect any final determinations made by the System Arbitrator or the Appeals Panel (as the case may be) in proceedings commenced pursuant to Article XXXII, Section 9(b) and involving disputes or claims with respect to such Interim Audit Report. The sole purpose for which any Interim Escrow Audit Report is to be used under this Agreement is to perform or form the basis for the calculations to be made pursuant to Section 12 below.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  For purposes of determining BRI, Total Salaries and Benefits and the Escrow Information, the Accountants shall perform at least such review procedures as shall be agreed upon by the parties. In connection with the preparation of Audit Reports for each Salary Cap Year, each Team and the NBA shall submit a report to the Accountants, the NBA and the Players Association setting forth BRI, Team Salaries and Benefits information for such Salary Cap Year, on forms agreed upon by the NBA, the Players Association and the Accountants (the ``BRI Reports''). The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon such forms no later than May 1 of each Salary Cap Year.
\item
  The Accountants shall review the reasonableness of any estimates of revenues or expenses for a Salary Cap Year included in the Teams' and the NBA's BRI Reports for such Salary Cap Year and may make such adjustments in such estimates as they deem appropriate. To the extent the actual amounts of revenues received or expenses incurred for a Salary Cap Year differ from such estimates, adjustments shall be made in BRI for the following Salary Cap Year in accordance with the provisions of Section 10(f) below.
\item
  With respect to expenses deducted by the NBA or the Teams, the NBA and the Teams shall report in BRI Reports only those expenses that are reasonable and customary in accordance with the provisions of Section 1(a) above. Subject to the terms of Section 1(a)(6) above and Section 11 below, all categories of expenses deducted in a BRI Report completed by the NBA or a Team shall be reviewed by the Accountants, but such categories shall be presumed to be reasonable and customary and the amount of the expenses deducted by the NBA or a Team that come within such expense categories shall also be presumed to be reasonable and customary, unless such categories or amounts are found by the Accountants to be either unrelated to the revenues involved or grossly excessive.
\item
  The Accountants shall notify designated representatives of the NBA and the Players Association: (1) if the Accountants have any questions concerning the amounts of revenues or expenses reported by the Teams and the NBA or any other information contained in the BRI Reports; or (2) if the Accountants propose that any adjustments be made to any revenue or expense item or any other information contained in the BRI Reports.
\item
  The Accountants shall indicate which amounts included in BRI for a Salary Cap Year, if any, represent estimates of revenues. With respect to any such estimated revenues, the Accountants shall, in preparing the Audit Report for the immediately succeeding Salary Cap Year (``Subsequent Audit Report''), or the Audit Report for the same Salary Cap Year in the event that an Interim Audit Report was previously issued for that Salary Cap Year, determine the actual revenues received for the prior Salary Cap Year and include as a credit or debit to BRI in such Subsequent Audit Report the amount of the aggregate difference, if any, between all such estimated revenues for the prior Salary Cap Year and the actual revenues received for such Salary Cap Year (the ``Estimated Revenue Adjustment'').
\item
  In the event that in the course of preparing an Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year the Accountants discover that they committed an error in computing BRI in the Audit Reports for either of the two (2) previous Salary Cap Years, which error resulted in a material understatement or overstatement of BRI for either of such Salary Cap Years, and the parties agree that such error was committed and agree as to the amount of the resulting understatement or overstatement (or, if they do not agree, an error (and the amount of such error) is established pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures provided for in this Agreement) the amount of such understatement or overstatement of BRI shall be added to or subtracted from BRI, as the case may be, with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the date of the issuance of such Audit Report) accruing from the date of the Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year in which such understatement or overstatement occurred in equal annual amounts over the then-current and subsequent Salary Cap Years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties will jointly instruct the Accountants that their audits shall not include procedures specifically designed to detect errors committed in prior audits.
\item
  In the event that there is an NHL players' strike or owners' lockout (``work stoppage'') resulting in the cancellation of all or part of any NHL season in any Salary Cap Year, and such work stoppage results in a refund being made to luxury suite-holders, premium seat license-holders or to purchasers of fixed arena signage and/or naming rights in arenas in which both an NBA Team and an NHL team plays its home games, then the revenues for luxury suites, premium seat licenses and fixed arena signage and/or naming rights in such arenas shall be determined as if such refunds were not made. If the work stoppage continues for a second year, then the NHL revenues shall be deemed to be the amount included for the prior year.
\item
  All disputes with respect to any Interim Audit Report shall be resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXXII.

  \textbf{Team Audits.} The Players Association shall have the right as part of the annual review of BRI Reports to retain its own accountants (the ``Players Association's Accountants''), at its own expense, after the submission of each Audit Report under this Agreement (the ``First Audit''), to audit the books and records of up to five (5) NBA teams (of its choosing) and shall also have the right to review the books and records of the NBA League Office; provided, however, that such review shall be limited to (1) revenue items, and (2) expense items that appear or should have appeared in the BRI Reports. In the event that, in the opinion of the Players Association's Accountants, such audit indicates misallocations or miscategorizations of revenues or expenses (other than with respect to matters that constituted Disputed Adjustments in connection with the prior Audit Report) resulting in an understatement of BRI in excess of \$3 million, they shall submit to the NBA proposed adjustments to BRI consistent with their findings. In the event that the NBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed adjustments shall be deemed to be ``Disputed Adjustments'' and shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXXII. In addition, in the event that First Audit Disputed Adjustments in excess of \$3 million are resolved in favor of the Players Association, the Players Association shall then have the right, that Season, to have the Players Association's Accountants audit up to an additional five (5) NBA teams, in accordance with the foregoing procedures (the ``Second Audit''). If, as a result of the Second Audit, additional Disputed Adjustments in excess of \$3 million are resolved in favor of the Players Association, the Players Association shall then have the right, that Season, to have the Players Association's Accountants audit all remaining NBA Teams. The amount of any and all Disputed Adjustments that are ultimately resolved in favor of the Players Association in accordance with this Section 11(a) shall be added to BRI in the Season in which such resolution is reached.
\item
  \textbf{Expense Audit.} The Players Association shall have the right to retain the Players Association's Accountants to conduct one (1) audit, at its own expense, of the expenses incurred in connection with the proceeds that come within Section 1(a)(1)(ix) above regardless of whether such expenses exceed the applicable BRI Expense Ratios set forth in Exhibit D. In the event that in the opinion of the Players Association's Accountants, such audit indicates a misallocation or miscategorization of expenses resulting in an understatement of BRI, they shall submit proposed adjustments to the NBA consistent with their findings. In the event the NBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed adjustments shall be deemed to be Disputed Adjustments and resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXXII. The amount of any and all such Disputed Adjustments that are resolved in the Players Association's favor shall be included in BRI in the Season in which such resolution is reached. In addition, in the event that any such Disputed Adjustments are resolved in the Players Association's favor, the Accountants shall be directed to correct such expense misallocations and/or miscategorizations in the remaining Seasons covered by the Agreement.
\item
  \textbf{Confidentiality.} In connection with any audit conducted by the Players Association pursuant to this Section 11, the Players Association agrees to sign, and to cause its representatives to sign, a confidentiality agreement in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit J-1. The Players Association also agrees to sign, and to cause its representatives to sign, a similar confidentiality agreement with respect to information obtained in connection with the Accountants' audit pursuant to Section 10 above.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The Tax Level commencing in 2013-14 or thereafter, and subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 12(a)(17)(iv) below, shall be an amount determined by the following calculation:\\
      STEP 1: Compute fifty-three and fifty-one one hundredths percent (53.51\%) of Projected BRI (as defined in Section 1(c) above).\\
      STEP 2: Subtract Projected Benefits (as defined in Article IV, Section 9) for such Salary Cap Year from the result in Step 1.\\
      STEP 3: Divide the result in Step 2 by the number of Teams scheduled to play in the NBA during such Salary Cap Year (excluding Expansion Teams during their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA).\\
      The Tax Level with respect to the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year shall be \$70.307 million. The Tax Level with respect to the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year shall equal the greater of (A) the amount determined using the calculation set forth in this Section 12(a)(17)(i), or (B) \$70.307 million.\\

    \item
      The Tax Level for a Salary Cap Year will be in effect commencing on the day following the last day of the Moratorium Period in such Salary Cap Year and shall continue through and including the last day of the Moratorium Period in the next Salary Cap Year.
    \item
      In the event that the Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year has not been completed as of the last day of the Moratorium Period immediately following the end of such Salary Cap Year and the NBA and the Players Association have not reached agreement on Projected BRI and Projected Benefits pursuant to Section 1 above and Article IV, Section 9 for the Salary Cap Year that commenced on the immediately preceding July 1, then the Tax Level for the Salary Cap Year that commenced on such immediately preceding July 1 will be calculated using Interim Projected BRI instead of Projected BRI, Estimated BRI instead of BRI and Estimated Benefits instead of Benefits for all purposes under this Section 12(a)(17) including, without limitation, the adjustments set forth in Section 12(a)(17)(vi) or (vii) below. In the event that the Interim Audit Report for the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year has not been completed as of the last day of the Moratorium Period immediately following the end of such Salary Cap Year and the NBA and Players Association have not reached agreement on Projected BRI and Projected Benefits pursuant to Section 1 above and Article IV, Section 9, then the Tax Level for the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year shall, until such Interim Audit Report is completed, be \$70.307 million. In the event that the Interim Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year, beginning with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year, has not been completed as of the last day of the Moratorium Period immediately following the end of such Salary Cap Year, and the NBA and Players Association have not reached agreement on Projected BRI and Projected Benefits pursuant to Section 1 above and Article IV, Section 9, then the Tax Level for the Salary Cap Year that commenced on the immediately preceding July 1 shall, until such Interim Audit Report is completed, be an amount that would have been the Tax Level for the preceding Salary Cap Year had Projected BRI or Interim Projected BRI, as the case may be, for such preceding Salary Cap Year included, with respect to the NBA's national broadcast, national telecast or network cable television contracts, the rights fees or other non-contingent payments stated in such contracts for the Season following the Season covered by such preceding Salary Cap Year instead of for the Season covered by such preceding Salary Cap Year.
    \item
      In the event that the Tax Level for a Salary Cap Year is calculated in accordance with Section 12(a)(17)(iv) above (i.e., is based upon an Interim Audit Report for the prior Salary Cap Year) and BRI and Benefits as set forth in the Audit Report for the prior Salary Cap Year are different from those in the Interim Audit Report such that the Tax Level would have been different from that based upon the Interim Audit Report, any such difference in the Tax Level shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to the Tax Level for the subsequent Salary Cap Year, except that, with respect to the 2020-21 Salary Cap Year (or, in the alternative, if either the NBA or the Players Association exercises its option to terminate this Agreement following the 2016-17 Salary Cap Year pursuant to Article XXXIX, the 2016-17 Salary Cap Year) any such differences shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to the Tax Level for the then-current Salary Cap Year, in all such cases with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the issuance of the Interim Audit Report).
    \item
      In the event that Total Salaries and Benefits for any Salary Cap Year beginning with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year are less than the Designated Share for such Salary Cap Year, then the Tax Level for the subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be increased by the amount of the shortfall divided by the number of Teams in the NBA during such subsequent Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA).
    \item
      In the event that there is an Overage (as defined in Section 12(a)(14) above) in any Salary Cap Year beginning with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year, then the Tax Level for the subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be adjusted as follows:

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{(\Alph{enumiv})}
      \tightlist
      \item
        If the amount of the Overage in a Salary Cap Year is equal to or less than six percent (6\%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then no adjustments shall be made to the Tax Level for the subsequent Salary Cap Year.
      \item
        If the amount of the Overage in a Salary Cap Year equals more than six percent (6\%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then the Tax Level for the subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by an amount to be calculated as follows:\\
        STEP 1: Subtract six percent (6\%) of Total Salaries and Benefits from the Overage.\\
        STEP 2: If Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year does not exceed BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year by more than eight percent (8\%) of BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year or if the amount of the Overage described above exceeds nine percent (9\%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then divide the result of Step 1 by the number of Teams in the NBA during the subsequent Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The result of this calculation is the amount of the reduction in the Tax Level for such subsequent Salary Cap Year, and no further steps are required.\\
        If Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year exceeds BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year by more than eight percent (8\%) of BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year and the amount of the Overage described above does not exceed nine percent (9\%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then proceed to Step 3.\\
        STEP 3: Subtract BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year from Projected BRI for the Salary Cap Year.\\
        STEP 4: Subtract eight percent (8\%) of BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year from the result of Step 3.\\
        STEP 5: Multiply the result of Step 4 by fifty-three and fifty-one one hundredths percent (53.51\%).\\
        STEP 6: Subtract the result of Step 5 from the result of Step 1. If the result of this step is less than zero, then no adjustments shall be made to the Tax Level for the subsequent Salary Cap Year, and no further steps are required.\\
        STEP 7: Divide the result of Step 6 by the number of Teams in the NBA during such subsequent Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The result of this step is the amount of the reduction in the Tax Level for such subsequent Salary Cap Year.\\
        \emph{Example: Assume Total Salaries and Benefits for the 2013-14 Season are \$2.27 billion and the Designated Share is \$2.1 billion resulting in an Overage of \$170 million (which equals 7.5\% of Total Salaries and Benefits). Assume Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season (\$4.41 billion) exceeds actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2 billion) by 5\%. Assume there are 30 Teams in the NBA in 2014-15. The Tax Level for the 2014-15 Season would be reduced by \$1.1 million ((7.5\% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$170 million) less 6\% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$136 million)) divided by 30).}\\
        \emph{Example: Same Total Salaries and Benefits as in the prior example, except assume Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season (\$4.578 billion) exceeds actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2 billion) by 9\%. The Tax Level for the 2014-15 Season would be reduced by \$0.38 million (\$34 million (the Overage of 7.5\% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$170 million) less 6\% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$136 million)), less \$22.5 million (i.e., the difference between (x) Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season (\$4.578 billion) less actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2 billion) (i.e., \$378 million) and (y) 8\% of actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (i.e., \$336 million) -- a difference of \$42 million -- multiplied by 53.51\%), divided by 30).}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    ``Trade Bonus Deduction Date'' means, with respect to an Adjustment Player, the earlier of (i) the date that any trade bonus earned by the player during the applicable Salary Cap Year is paid to the player pursuant to this Contract, or (ii) the June 30 of such Salary Cap Year.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Compensation Adjustment Rules.}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the event that there is an Overage in any Salary Cap Year, (i) the Contracts of all Adjustment Players shall be amended by operation of this Agreement, such that the aggregate Compensation otherwise payable to all such Adjustment Players with respect to such Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by the Aggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount, (ii) the New Benefit Amount for such Season as provided for by Article IV, Section 8(a)(1) (i.e., the New Benefit amount that is presently specified in Article IV, Section 8(a)(1) or such lesser New Benefit Amount as is designated by the Players Association, in accordance with the provisions of Article IV, Section 8(a)(1), by notice in writing to the NBA delivered on or before the March 15 prior to the commencement of the Salary Cap Year encompassing such Season) shall be reduced by the New Benefit Adjustment Amount, and (iii) the Additional Benefit Amount as provided for by Article IV, Section 4(c) (i.e., the one percent (1\%) of BRI for additional benefits) shall be reduced by any remaining Overage after applying the reductions set forth in Section 12(b)(1)(i)-(ii).
  \item
    Subject to Section 12(d) and (e) below, to effectuate the aggregate Compensation reduction provided for in Section 12(b)(1)(i) above, the Compensation otherwise payable in accordance with each Adjustment Player's Contract shall be reduced by the player's respective Individual Compensation Adjustment Amount.
  \item
    The Designated Share for the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year shall equal fifty-one and fifteen one hundredths percent (51.15\%) of BRI for such Salary Cap Year. Commencing with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year, the Designated Share for each Salary Cap Year for the remainder of the term of this Agreement shall equal fifty percent (50\%) of BRI for such Salary Cap Year, provided that the Designated Share for a Salary Cap Year shall be increased or decreased in accordance with the following: (i) in the event that BRI for a Salary Cap Year exceeds the amount of BRI forecasted for such Salary Cap Year as set forth below, then the Designated Share for such Salary Cap Year shall equal fifty percent (50\%) of the amount of BRI forecasted for such Salary Cap Year, plus sixty and one-half percent (60.5\%) of the difference between the BRI for such Salary Cap Year and the BRI forecasted for such Salary Cap Year; and (ii) in the event that BRI forecasted for a Salary Cap Year as set forth below exceeds BRI for such Salary Cap Year, then the Designated Share for such Salary Cap Year shall equal fifty percent (50\%) of the amount of BRI forecasted for such Salary Cap Year, less sixty and one-half percent (60.5\%) of the difference between the BRI forecasted for such Salary Cap Year and BRI for such Salary Cap Year. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in no event shall the Designated Share for any Salary Cap Year commencing with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year be less than forty-nine percent (49\%) of BRI or greater than fifty-one percent (51\%) of BRI. To illustrate the foregoing, (X) if BRI for the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year were to equal \$4.408 billion, then the Designated Share for the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year would equal \$2.2145 billion (\$2.154 billion (forecasted BRI of \$4.308 billion multiplied by 50\%) plus \$60.5 million (60.5\% of \$100 million -- the difference between BRI of \$4.408 billion and forecasted BRI of \$4.308 billion), which would equate to 50.24\% of BRI; (Y) if BRI for the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year were to equal \$4.208 billion, then the Designated Share for the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year would equal \$2.0935 billion (\$2.154 billion (forecasted BRI of \$4.308 billion multiplied by 50\%) less \$60.5 million (60.5\% of \$100 million -- the difference between forecasted BRI of \$4.308 billion and BRI of \$4.208 billion), which would equate to 49.75\% of BRI; and (Z) if BRI for the 2014-15 Salary Cap Year were to equal \$5.2 billion, then the Designated Share for the 2014-15 Salary Cap Year would equal \$2.652 billion or 51\% of BRI (since the amount per the calculation would exceed 51\% of BRI -- \$2.330 billion (forecasted BRI of \$4.660 billion multiplied by 50\%) plus \$326.7 million (60.5\% of \$540 million -- the difference between BRI of \$5.2 billion and forecasted BRI of \$4.660 billion) would equal \$2.657 billion or 51.1\% of BRI):

  \textbf{Escrow Procedure.}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The following shall apply with respect to each Salary Cap Year (subject to Section 12(d) below regarding final reconciliation):

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The Compensation otherwise payable to each Adjustment Player shall be reduced by the Escrow Amount applicable to such Adjustment Player; and
    \item
      Each Team shall deposit the Escrow Amount with respect to each of its Adjustment Players with the Escrow Agent.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Except as set forth in Section 12(c)(4) below: (i) the Base Escrow Amount for each Adjustment Player shall be collected in twelve (12) equal installments from each of the player's semi-monthly Compensation payments on each Deduction Date; (ii) the Performance Bonus Escrow Amount for each Adjustment Player shall be collected in one (1) installment on the Performance Bonus Deduction Date; and (iii) the Trade Bonus Escrow Amount for each Adjustment Player shall be collected in one (1) installment on the Trade Bonus Deduction Date.
  \item
    The procedure for deducting and depositing Escrow Amounts shall be as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \item
      The NBA will prepare and send to the Players Association the Escrow Schedules on or before November 8 of each Salary Cap Year, and periodically thereafter to reflect any new or adjusted Escrow Amounts calculated in accordance with Section 12 (c)(4) below.
    \item
      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{(\Alph{enumiv})}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Within three (3) business days after each Deduction Date, each Team shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, in accordance with the Salary Escrow Agreement, the aggregate Base Escrow Amounts that the Team is obligated to deduct with respect to such Deduction Date for all of its Adjustment Players. Within three (3) business days following the date of the last game of the NBA Finals occurring during each Salary Cap Year, each Team shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, in accordance with the Salary Escrow Agreement, the aggregate Performance Bonus Escrow Amounts for all of its Adjustment Players. Within three (3) business days following an Adjustment Player's Trade Bonus Deduction Date, the player's Team shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, in accordance with the Salary Escrow Agreement, the player's Trade Bonus Escrow Amount. All amounts received by the Escrow Agent shall be invested and disbursed in accordance with the provisions of the Salary Escrow Agreement.
      \item
        It is the intention of the NBA and the Players Association that the provisions of this Section 12(c) result each Salary Cap Year in the delivery to the Escrow Agent, with respect to each Adjustment Player, of the player's full Escrow Amount. Accordingly, if for any reason the procedures in this Section 12(c) would result in less than the full Escrow Amount with respect to any Adjustment Player being delivered to the Escrow Agent, the NBA and the Players Association shall agree on such supplemental measures as are necessary to effectuate the deduction of the appropriate amount from the player's Compensation for delivery to the Escrow Agent.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    After November 8, the NBA shall periodically update the Escrow Schedules to add Escrow Amounts for players who enter into new Player Contracts and to make such adjustments as may be necessary to previously-listed Escrow Amounts (such as adjustments resulting from earned Performance Bonuses, Contract terminations, Renegotiations, etc.). Any portion of a Base Escrow Amount that has not been deducted as of the date any such updated Schedules are prepared shall be deducted in equal installments from each of the remaining semi-monthly Compensation payments to be made to the player from November 15 through May 1 of the applicable Salary Cap Year.
  \item
    Within seven (7) days after receiving any set of Escrow Schedules from the NBA, or within seven (7) days after any event that the Players Association believes warrants a change in any previously-issued Schedules, the Players Association may bring a proceeding before the System Arbitrator, in accordance with Article XXXII, Section 10, contesting the NBA's calculation of any player's Escrow Amount for such Salary Cap Year. Notwithstanding the commencement of any such proceeding, each Team shall commence and continue remitting to the Escrow Agent the total deductions due with respect to each Deduction Date and each Performance Bonus Deduction Date as set forth in the Schedules, and in no event shall any Team be prohibited from remitting to the Escrow Agent any such deduction prior to a final determination in any such proceeding.
  \item
    In the event that the NBA makes a determination in accordance with Section 12(c)(4) above, or a final determination is made in a proceeding in accordance with Section 12(c)(5) above, that an Escrow Amount was erroneously calculated by the NBA, the sole remedy with respect to any amounts erroneously deducted from the player's Salary shall be to modify, as soon as practicable, the deduction schedule applicable to such player so as to reduce, in equal amounts, all scheduled future deductions from post-determination payments of Compensation until the amount of any prior over-deduction is fully off-set; provided, however, that to the extent that reducing the player's future deductions would not fully offset the prior over-deductions, the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the player as soon as practicable, with interest, such additional amounts as are necessary to fully off-set such over-deductions.

    The Individual Shortfall Adjustment Amount for each Adjustment Player whose Contract is amended in accordance with Section 12(e)(1) above shall be calculated by multiplying the Aggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount Shortfall for the prior Salary Cap Year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the player's then-current Salary, and the denominator of which is the sum of all such players' then-current Salaries. For purposes of calculating the fraction described in the preceding sentence, the Salary of a player making the Minimum Player Salary shall include the portion of such Minimum Player Salary that is reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits fund described in Article IV, Section 6(k)(2).(3) The Individual Shortfall Adjustment Amount for each Adjustment Player shall be deducted by the player's Team in four (4) equal installments from each of the player's first four (4) semi-monthly payment dates under paragraph 3 of the Uniform Player Contract following delivery to the Escrow Agent of the completed Notice to the NBA and the Players Association.

      amounts not distributed in accordance with Section 12(g)(1)(i) above shall be used for one (1) or more ``League purposes'' (as defined in Section 12(g)(3) below) selected by the NBA.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    The tax amounts remitted to the NBA by NBA Teams pursuant to Section 12(f) above for each Salary Cap Year shall be used and/or distributed as follows:

      the NBA may elect to distribute up to fifty percent (50\%) of such amounts to one (1) or more Teams based in whole or in part on the fact that such Team(s) did not owe a tax for such Salary Cap Year (e.g., the NBA could elect to distribute fifty percent (50\%) of such amounts in equal shares to all non-taxpayers in such Salary Cap Year); and

    For purposes of this Section 12(g), the use of Escrow Amounts or tax amounts for a ``League purpose'' shall mean the use of such amounts for any purpose, including, but not limited to, the distribution of such amounts to one (1) or more Teams; provided, however, that such amounts may not be distributed to a Team or expended for the benefit or detriment of a Team in a manner that is based, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, on the amount of the Team's Team Salary or on whether the Team is a taxpayer. Without limiting the foregoing, a team assistance plan adopted by the NBA and funded, in whole or in part, with Escrow Amounts and/or tax amounts shall be considered a ``League purpose'' if, pursuant to the plan, a Team's entitlement to an assistance receipt and/or the amount of such receipt is based, in whole or in part, on a profit, loss, and/or expense computation determined by the NBA under which the Team is credited with a Team Salary no less than the league average; provided, however, that in order to qualify as a ``League purpose,'' such a plan may not otherwise base a Team's entitlement to assistance and/or the amount of such assistance on the amount of a Team's Team Salary or on whether the Team is a taxpayer.

      For purposes of the computations made by the Accountants pursuant to Section 10 above and this Section 12, the Salary of a player who is suspended by the NBA -- but not by a Team -- shall be reduced (for the Salary Cap Year covering the Season during which the player is suspended) by an amount equal to fifty percent (50\%) of the suspension-related Compensation amount that is collected from the player and retained by the NBA at the time the computations of the Accountants are made. Other than as set forth in the preceding sentence, the computation of a player's Salary under this Agreement shall be made without regard to any reduction in Compensation that results from the player's suspension by the NBA or his Team.

      When (A) a player has forfeited a portion of his Compensation for a Season as a result of a suspension imposed by the NBA or his Team and (B) the player's Compensation is later reduced pursuant to Section 12(b)(1) and (2) above, the player shall be entitled to a refund of a portion of the Compensation forfeited as a result of the suspension. The refund shall be in an amount equal to (x) the player's Individual Compensation Adjustment Amount for the Salary Cap Year to which the suspension related multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the player's Compensation that was forfeited as a result of the suspension and the denominator of which is the player's Base Compensation for such Season as of the date(s) he served the suspension, less (y) all amounts required to be withheld by federal, state, and local authorities. For purposes of the calculation required in clause (x) above, a player's Individual Compensation Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to include only the portion of the player's Individual Compensation Adjustment Amount that relates to the player's Base Compensation earned under the Player Contract for the NBA team that the player was playing for while he was suspended. Such refund shall be made to the player within thirty (30) days following the Accountants' submission to the NBA and the Players Association of a final Audit Report or an Interim Escrow Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year covering the Season for which the suspension-related Compensation amount is collected.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    In the event that the Overage for any Salary Cap Year exceeds the total of (i) the Aggregate Salaries and Benefits Adjustment Amount for such Salary Cap Year, plus (ii) the Additional Benefit Amount as provided for by Article IV, Section 4(c) for such Salary Cap Year, the NBA shall not be entitled to reduce player Compensation in such Salary Cap Year or any subsequent Salary Cap Year so as to recover any amounts in excess of the Aggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount.

  \textbf{Amnesty Procedures.}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\arabic{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A Team may designate an Amnesty Player by providing written notice of such designation to the NBA during an Amnesty Designation Period. The ``Amnesty Designation Periods'' are:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      With respect to the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year, the period from December 9, 2011 through December 16, 2011;
    \item
      With respect to the 2012-13 through 2015-16 Salary Cap Years, the seven (7)-day period beginning on the day following the last day of the Moratorium Period for each such Salary Cap Year.
    \end{enumerate}

    For players described in Section 12(f)(5)(i) above, the Team's designation of the Amnesty Player must be accompanied by a request for waivers on such player, and the player's Salary shall be excluded from the Team's Team Salary immediately upon such request for waivers. For players described in Section 12(f)(5)(ii) above, the player's Salary shall be excluded from the Team's Team Salary immediately upon the designation of the Amnesty Player.
  \item
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a Team may not re-sign or re-acquire an Amnesty Player prior to the end of the last Season of the player's Contract (including any unprotected years or Option Year) under which Salary was excluded from such Team's Team Salary pursuant to Section 12(f)(5) above.
  \item
    Upon the waiver of an Amnesty Player described in Section 12(f)(5)(i) above, the following ``Amnesty Waiver Procedure'' shall apply:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\roman{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The waiver period shall be the same as the period for other non-amnesty waivers.
    \item
      Any Team other than the Team requesting the waiver may submit either a Full Waiver Claim or a Partial Waiver Claim for the player. A ``Full Waiver Claim'' is a claim for the full value of the remaining term of the Contract pursuant to Section 5 of the NBA By-Laws. A ``Partial Waiver Claim'' is a discount bid of a single dollar amount (rounded to the nearest dollar) for a portion of the value of the remaining term of the Contract. A Partial Waiver Claim can be for any amount equal to or greater than the total of the applicable Minimum Player Salary for all of the Remaining Protected Years (as defined below) of the Contract and less than the total of the full Base Compensation provided for in all of the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract, provided that a Partial Waiver Claim may never be less than the total of the unprotected Base Compensation provided for in all of the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract. A ``Remaining Protected Year'' means any remaining year of the Contract that contains any amount of Base Compensation protection that is not contingent on some event occurring on a date after the request for waivers; any remaining years of the Contract that are not Remaining Protected Years shall hereinafter be referred to as ``Remaining Unprotected Years.''
    \item
      In order to submit a Partial Waiver Claim, the Team must have a Team Salary below the Salary Cap and room equal to at least the portion of the Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation (as defined in subsection (vi)(A) below) plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to the first Year of the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract. For purposes of the preceding sentence, ``room'' includes room that can be unilaterally created by the claiming Team (e.g., via renouncements or waivers, but not via trades) and such room must be created immediately upon the awarding of the player pursuant to the Amnesty Waiver Procedure.
    \item
      If at least one (1) Full Waiver Claim is submitted during the waiver period, the Contract shall be awarded to the Team submitting a Full Waiver Claim that is entitled to the highest order of preference in accordance with the waiver procedures set forth in the NBA Constitution and By-Laws. If no Full Waiver Claim is submitted and at least one (1) Partial Waiver Claim is submitted, the Contract shall be awarded to the Team submitting the highest Partial Waiver Claim in total dollars (or, if more than one (1) Team submits the highest Partial Waiver Claim in total dollars, to the Team submitting the highest Partial Waiver Claim in total dollars that is entitled to the highest order of preference in accordance with the waiver procedures set forth in the NBA Constitution and By-Laws).
    \item
      If there is no Full Waiver Claim or Partial Waiver Claim submitted for the Contract during the waiver period, the Contract shall be terminated.
    \item
      In the event that the Contract is awarded to a Team (the ``Claiming Team'') as the result of a Partial Waiver Claim:

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{(\Alph{enumiv})}
      \tightlist
      \item
        The Claiming Team shall be responsible for payment of the player's Base Compensation in an amount equal to the total dollar amount of the Partial Waiver Claim allocated over the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract in proportion to the Base Compensation amounts provided for in each Remaining Protected Year of the Contract (e.g., if the player has two (2) years remaining on his Contract with a \$10 million fully-protected Base Compensation in year one and an \$11 million fifty percent (50\%) protected Base Compensation in year two and the winning Partial Waiver Claim was for \$6 million, the Claiming Team shall be responsible for \$2.86 million of the player's Base Compensation in year one and \$3.14 million in year two) (the ``Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation''). The waiving team shall be responsible for paying the total Base Compensation in each Remaining Protected Year of the Contract less the Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation for each Remaining Protected Year of the Contract (the ``Waiving Team Base Compensation Obligation''). In addition to the Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation, the Claiming Team shall also be responsible for the total amount of all other non Base Compensation obligations contained in the Contract (including, but not limited to, the full amount of all Incentive Compensation) and the total Base Compensation for any Remaining Unprotected Year.
      \item
        The Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to each Remaining Protected Year of the Contract and the total Base Compensation plus any Likely Bonuses of any Remaining Unprotected Year shall be included in the Team Salary of the Claiming Team immediately upon the awarding of the player to the Claiming Team pursuant to the Amnesty Waiver Procedure.
      \item
        The Claiming Team may not trade a player awarded as a result of a Partial Waiver Claim until the July 1 following the Amnesty Designation Period during which the player was waived. If a Claiming Team trades a player awarded as a result of a Partial Waiver Claim (after the waiting period set forth in the preceding sentence), the acquiring Team must have room (or a Traded Player Exception in accordance with the rules set forth in Section 6(j) above) in an amount equal to at least the Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to the then-current Salary Cap Year.

      \item
        Without taking into consideration any Triggered Base Compensation Protection, if the Contract contains partial protection in one (1) or more of the Remaining Protected Years, the Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation and Waiving Team Base Compensation Obligation for each such year shall be adjusted as follows upon the termination of the Contract:

        The full amount of any Triggered Base Compensation Protection shall be added to the Adjusted Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation in each remaining year of Contract that contains Triggered Base Compensation Protection.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      In the event that the Contract is awarded to a Team as a result of a Subsequent Waiver, the Team that is awarded the Contract becomes the Claiming Team for the purposes of this Section 12(j) (and, accordingly, must have room (or a Traded Player Exception) in an amount equal to at least the Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to the then-current Salary Cap Year).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\item
  Each Rookie Scale Contract between a Team and a First Round Pick shall cover a period of two (2) Seasons, but shall have an Option in favor of the Team for the player's third Season and a second Option in favor of the Team for the player's fourth Season. The Option for the player's third Season shall be exercisable during the period from the day following the last day of the first Season through the immediately following October 31. The Option for the player's fourth Season shall be exercisable during the period from the day following the last day of the second Season through the immediately following October 31. Such Options shall be exercisable by notice to the player that is either personally delivered to the player or his representative or sent by pre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of the player or his representative, signed by the Team, informing the player that the Team has exercised such Option.
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\roman{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The Rookie Salary Scale applicable to a First Round Pick is determined by the first Season to be covered by the player's Rookie Scale Contract. Accordingly, for example, if a player's Rookie Scale Contract commences with the 2011-12 Season, the 2011-12 Rookie Salary Scale shall apply. Within a particular Rookie Salary Scale, a First Round Pick's applicable Rookie Scale Amounts are determined by the player's selection number in the NBA Draft. Accordingly, for example, the Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to the eighth player selected in the first round of the NBA Draft shall be those specified in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale for the eighth pick. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1(b)(i) or in Section 1(b)(ii) below, beginning on January 10 of each Season, an unsigned First Round Pick's applicable Rookie Scale Amount for such Season shall be reduced daily through the end of the Regular Season by the product of the applicable Rookie Scale Amount (as set forth in Exhibit B annexed hereto) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such Regular Season.
  \item
    Notwithstanding Section 1(b)(i) above, if, pursuant to any provision of this Agreement or the NBA Constitution and By-Laws, one (1) or more Teams is required to forfeit one (1) or more draft picks in the first round of a particular NBA Draft, then:
    (A) the Rookie Salary Scale for the Salary Cap Year immediately following such Draft shall be adjusted by removing one (1) or more Rookie Scale Amounts from the middle of the Rookie Salary Scale, as follows: if one (1) first round pick is forfeited, then the Rookie Scale Amounts that would have been applicable to the 15th player selected in the first round (absent any forfeiture of picks) (hereinafter, the ``15th Pick'') shall be removed from the Rookie Salary Scale; if two (2) first round picks are forfeited, then the Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to the 15th Pick and the pick immediately following the 15th Pick shall be removed from the Rookie Salary Scale; if three (3) first round picks are forfeited, then the Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to the 15th Pick and the picks immediately preceding and immediately following the 15th Pick shall be removed from the Rookie Salary Scale; and if more than three picks are forfeited, additional Rookie Scale Amounts shall be removed from the Rookie Salary Scale in accordance with the foregoing procedure; and
    (B) the Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to players selected in such Draft shall be determined by their selection number under the Rookie Salary Scale as adjusted by Section 1(b)(ii)(A) above. Accordingly, for example, if one First Round Pick were forfeited in the first round of the 2012 Draft, the applicable Rookie Scale Amounts would remain unchanged for the first 14 picks, and the Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to the remaining 15 picks in the first round would be the Rookie Scale Amounts that (absent any forfeiture of picks) would have been applicable to picks 16 through 30.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\roman{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A Rookie Scale Contract shall provide in each of the two (2) Seasons covered by the Contract and the first Option Year at least eighty percent (80\%) of the applicable Rookie Scale Amount in Current Base Compensation. Components of Salary in excess of eighty percent (80\%), if any, are subject to individual negotiation, except that (i) in no event may Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for any Salary Cap Year exceed one hundred twenty percent (120\%) of the applicable Rookie Scale Amount, and (ii) a Rookie Scale Contract may not provide for a signing bonus (except for an ``international player'' payment in excess of the Excluded International Player Payment Amount made in accordance with Article VII, Section 3(e)) or a loan. A Rookie Scale Contract may provide for a payment schedule in any Season that is more favorable to the player than that called for under paragraph 3 of the Uniform Player Contract, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.
  \item
    A Rookie Scale Contract must provide for Compensation protection for lack of skill and injury or illness in each of the two (2) Seasons covered by the Contract and the first Option Year to the extent of not less than eighty percent (80\%) of the applicable Rookie Scale Amount. Consistent with the provisions of Article II, Section 4, a Team and a First Round Pick may negotiate additional conditions or limitations applicable to the player's Base Compensation protection, except that lack of skill and injury or illness protection to the extent of at least eighty percent (80\%) of the applicable Rookie Scale Amount in each of the first two (2) Seasons and the first Option Year shall contain no such individually-negotiated additional conditions or limitations.
  \item
    The terms and conditions that apply to the second Option Year shall be unchanged from all terms and conditions that applied to the player's first Option Year (including but not limited to the percentage of Base Compensation that is protected), except that the Salary, (excluding Incentive Compensation), Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses for the second Option Year shall be increased over the Salary (excluding Incentive Compensation), Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the first Option Year by the applicable percentage specified in Exhibit B hereto.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a trade of a Rookie Scale Contract would, by reason of a trade bonus contained in such Contract, cause the player's Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the Salary Cap Year in which such trade occurs to exceed one hundred twenty percent (120\%) of the player's applicable Rookie Scale Amount for such Salary Cap Year, such player's trade bonus shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to reduce the player's Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for such Salary Cap Year to one hundred twenty percent (120\%) of the applicable Rookie Scale Amount.

In addition, any Team that fails to make a Required Tender to a First Round Pick, withdraws a Required Tender to a First Round Pick, renounces a First Round Pick, or fails to sign within one (1) year a First Round Pick selected in a Subsequent Draft shall be prohibited from signing such player until after he has signed a Player Contract with another NBA Team, and either (a) the player completes the playing services called for under the Contract, or (b) the Contract is terminated in accordance with the NBA waiver procedure.

    From the day following the Season covered by the second Option Year of a First Round Pick's Rookie Scale Contract through the immediately following June 30, the player's Team may make a Qualifying Offer to the player. If such a Qualifying Offer is made, then, on the July 1 following such Season, the player shall become a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First Refusal in favor of the Team (``ROFR Team''), as set forth in Section 5 below. If such a Qualifying Offer is not made, then the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent on such July 1. If a Team does not timely exercise its Option with respect to the first Option Year or second Option Year of a player's Rookie Scale Contract in accordance with Article VIII, the player shall, following his second or third Season (as the case may be) become an Unrestricted Free Agent.
  \item
    A Team that makes a Qualifying Offer to a player following the second Option Year of his Rookie Scale Contract may elect simultaneously to offer the player an alternative Contract covering five (5) Seasons that provides Salary for the first Salary Cap Year equal to the Maximum Annual Salary under Article II, Section 7(a), with annual increases in Salary equal to seven and one-half percent (7.5\%) of the Salary for the first Salary Cap Year (a ``Maximum Qualifying Offer''). Providing a player with a Maximum Qualifying Offer shall have the consequence described in Section 5(b) below. A Maximum Qualifying Offer shall be subject to the following:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{(\Alph{enumiii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      A Maximum Qualifying Offer shall contain only Base Compensation and no bonuses of any kind.
    \item
      A Maximum Qualifying Offer shall state that the player's Base Compensation for the first Season shall equal ``the Maximum Annual Salary applicable to the player in the first Season of the Contract,'' and that the Base Compensation in each of the four (4) subsequent Seasons shall ``be increased by seven and one-half percent (7.5\%) of the Base Compensation for the first Season.'' Such a Contract, if timely accepted by the player in accordance with Section 4(a)(ii)(D) below, shall be deemed amended to provide for specific Base Compensation for each Season covered by the Contract, based on the Maximum Annual Salary applicable to the player in the first Season.
    \item
      A Maximum Qualifying Offer cannot contain an Option or ETO, and must provide full Base Compensation protection in each Season for lack of skill and injury or illness (with no individually-negotiated conditions or limitations on such protection).
    \item
      The Team's offer of a Maximum Qualifying Offer must remain open for the same period that the player's Qualifying Offer remains open and cannot be withdrawn, except that if the Team withdraws its Qualifying Offer, the Maximum Qualifying Offer shall be deemed to be withdrawn simultaneously.
    \item
      A player may accept either his Qualifying Offer or his Maximum Qualifying Offer, but not both.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Any Veteran Free Agent (other than a First Round Pick whose first Option Year or second Option Year was not exercised) who will have three (3) or fewer Years of Service as of the June 30 following the end of the last Season covered by his Player Contract will be a Restricted Free Agent if his Prior Team makes a Qualifying Offer to the player at any time from the day following such Season through the immediately following June 30. If such a Qualifying Offer is made, then, on the July 1 following the last Season covered by the player's Player Contract, the player shall become a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First Refusal in favor of the Team (``ROFR Team''), as set forth in Section 5 below. If such a Qualifying Offer is not made, then the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent on such July 1.
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\roman{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A player who receives a Qualifying Offer must be given until the October 1 following its issuance to accept it. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Qualifying Offer may be withdrawn by the Team at any time through the July 23 following its issuance. If the Qualifying Offer is not withdrawn on or before July 23, it may be withdrawn thereafter but only if the player agrees in writing to the withdrawal. If a Qualifying Offer is withdrawn, the player shall immediately become an Unrestricted Free Agent. If a Qualifying Offer is withdrawn on or after July 24, the Team also shall be deemed to have renounced the player in accordance with Article VII, Section 4(g). A player may not accept a Qualifying Offer after the October 1 following the issuance thereof, unless the Team, prior to October 1, extends the date by which the player may accept the Qualifying Offer. In order to extend the date by which a player may accept his Qualifying Offer, a Team shall provide the player with written notice of the extension, which shall be either personally delivered to the player or his representative or sent by pre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of the player or his representative. In no event may the acceptance date for a Qualifying Offer be extended beyond, or may a player accept a Qualifying Offer beyond, the March 1 following its issuance.
  \item
    If a Qualifying Offer is neither withdrawn nor accepted and the deadline for accepting it passes, the Team's Right of First Refusal shall continue, subject to Section 5(a) below.
  \item
    A player who knows that he has a physical disability that would render him physically unable to perform the playing services required under a Player Contract the following Season may not validly accept a Qualifying Offer received under this Section 4 or Section 5 below, unless the ROFR Team consents after disclosure of such physical disability. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, a player who knows that he has a physical disability that would render him physically unable to perform the playing services required under a Player Contract the following Season remains subject to the ROFR Team's Right of First Refusal.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Any claim that a Contract offered as a Qualifying Offer or a Maximum Qualifying Offer fails to meet one or more of the criteria for a Qualifying Offer or a Maximum Qualifying Offer shall be made by notice to the Team, in writing, no later than ten (10) days after a copy of the Qualifying Offer or Maximum Qualifying Offer was given by the Team or the NBA to the Players Association. Such notice must set forth the specific changes that allegedly must be made to the offered Contract in order for it to constitute a Qualifying Offer or a Maximum Qualifying Offer. Upon receipt of such notice, if the requested changes are necessary to satisfy the requirements of a Qualifying Offer or a Maximum Qualifying Offer, the Team may, within five (5) business days, offer the player an amended Contract incorporating the requested changes. If the Team offers such an amended Contract, the player and the Players Association shall be precluded from asserting that such Contract does not constitute a timely and valid Qualifying Offer or Maximum Qualifying Offer.

\item
  If a Restricted Free Agent does not sign an Offer Sheet with any Team by March 1 of the Season for which the Qualifying Offer is made, and does not sign a Player Contract with the ROFR Team before that Season ends, then his ROFR Team may reassert its Right of First Refusal for the following Season by extending another Qualifying Offer (with the same terms, including the amount of Salary (excluding Incentive Compensation), Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, that were included in the prior Qualifying Offer) on or before the next June 30. A ROFR Team may continue to reassert its Right of First Refusal by following the foregoing procedure in each subsequent year in which that Restricted Free Agent does not sign an Offer Sheet with any Team by March 1 of the Season for which the Qualifying Offer is made, and does not sign a Player Contract with the ROFR Team before that Season ends. In each Season in which a Team reasserts its Right of First Refusal by extending another Qualifying Offer in accordance with this Section 5(a), the Team may also elect to simultaneously provide the player with a Maximum Qualifying Offer (with the same terms that were included in the prior Maximum Qualifying Offer). Any such Qualifying Offer and Maximum Qualifying Offer shall be governed by the provisions of Section 4 above.
\item
  When a Restricted Free Agent receives an offer to sign a Player Contract from a Team other than the ROFR Team (the ``New Team''), which he desires to accept, he shall give to the ROFR Team a completed certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G annexed hereto (the ``Offer Sheet''), signed by the Restricted Free Agent and the New Team, which shall have attached to it a Uniform Player Contract separately specifying: (i) the ``Principal Terms'' (as defined in Section 5(d) below) of the New Team's offer; and (ii) any non-Principal Terms of the New Team's offer that the ROFR Team is not required to match (as specified in Section 5(d) below) but which would be included in the player's Player Contract with the New Team if the ROFR Team does not exercise its Right of First Refusal. The Offer Sheet must be for a Player Contract with a term of more than one (1) season (not including any Option Year), unless the ROFR team has tendered the player both a Qualifying Offer and a Maximum Qualifying Offer, in which case the Offer Sheet must be for a Player Contract with a term of more than two (2) Seasons (not including any Option Year). In order to extend an Offer Sheet, the New Team must have Room for the player's Player Contract at the time the Offer Sheet is signed and must continue to have such Room at all times while the Offer Sheet is outstanding. The ROFR Team, upon receipt of the Offer Sheet, may exercise its Right of First Refusal, which shall have the consequences hereinafter set forth below in this Section 5. In order to match an Offer Sheet, the ROFR Team must have Room for the player's Player Contract at the time notice of the Team's exercise of its Right of First Refusal is given and must continue to have Room at all times the First Refusal Exercise Notice remains in effect.
\item
  The following rules shall govern the signing of an Offer Sheet by a Restricted Free Agent who has one (1) or two (2) Years of Service:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\roman{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no such Offer Sheet may provide for Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year totaling more than the amount of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception for such Salary Cap Year. Annual increases or decreases in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(c)(1).
  \item
    If an Offer Sheet provides for the maximum allowable amount of Salary for the first two (2) Salary Cap Years pursuant to Section 5(c)(i) above, then, subject to Section 5(c)(iii) below, the Offer Sheet may provide for Salary for the third Salary Cap Year of up to the maximum amount that the player would have been eligible to receive for the third Salary Cap Year, absent the restriction in the first sentence of Section 5(c)(i) above and had the player's Salary for the first two (2) Salary Cap Years been the maximum amount permitted under Article II, Section 7(a) and Article VII, Section 5(c)(1). If the Offer Sheet provides for Salary for the third Salary Cap Year in accordance with the foregoing sentence, then, subject to Section 5(c)(iii) below, (A) the player's Salary for the fourth Salary Cap Year may increase or decrease in relation to the third Salary Cap Year's Salary by no more than four and one tenth percent(4.1\%) of the Salary for the third Salary Cap Year, (B) the Offer Sheet cannot contain bonuses of any kind, and (C) the Offer Sheet must provide for one hundred percent (100\%) of the Base Compensation in each Season to be protected for lack of skill and injury or illness.
  \item
    If a Team extends an Offer Sheet in accordance with Section 5(c)(ii) above, then, for purposes of determining whether the Team has Room for the Offer Sheet, the Salary for the first Salary Cap Year covered by the Offer Sheet shall be deemed to equal the average of the aggregate Salaries for such Salary Cap Year and each subsequent Salary Cap Year covered by the Offer Sheet. If the ROFR Team does not exercise its Right of First Refusal, the player's Salary for each Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract with the Team that extended the Offer Sheet shall be deemed to equal the average of the aggregate Salaries for each such Salary Cap Year. If the ROFR Team exercises its Right of First Refusal, the player's Salary for each Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract with the ROFR Team shall be the Salary for such Salary Cap Year as set forth in the Contract.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  The Principal Terms of an Offer Sheet are only:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\roman{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the term of the Contract;
  \item
    the fixed and specified Compensation that the New Team will pay or lend to the Restricted Free Agent as a signing bonus, Current Base Compensation, and/or Deferred Base Compensation in specified installments on specified dates;
  \item
    Incentive Compensation; provided, however, that the only elements of such Incentive Compensation that shall be included in the Principal Terms are the following: (A) bonuses that qualify as Likely Bonuses based upon the performance of the Team extending the Offer Sheet and the ROFR Team; and (B) Generally Recognized League Honors; and(iv) Any allowable amendments to the terms contained in the Uniform Player Contract (e.g., Base Compensation protection, a trade bonus, etc.).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  If, within three (3) days from the date it receives an Offer Sheet, the ROFR Team gives to the Restricted Free Agent a ``First Refusal Exercise Notice'' substantially in the form of Exhibit H annexed hereto, then, subject to Section 5(h) below, such Restricted Free Agent and the ROFR Team shall be deemed to have entered into a Player Contract containing all the Principal Terms (but not any terms other than the Principal Terms) included in the Uniform Player Contract attached to the Offer Sheet (except that if the Contract contains an Exhibit 6, such Exhibit 6 shall be deemed deleted). Such Contract may not thereafter be amended in any manner for a period of one (1) year.
\item
  If the ROFR Team does not give the First Refusal Exercise Notice within the aforementioned three (3) day period, or if during such three (3) day period the ROFR Team provides written notice to the player that the Team declines to exercise its Right of First Refusal, then the player and the New Team shall be deemed to have entered into a Player Contract containing all of the terms and conditions included in the Uniform Player Contract attached to the Offer Sheet (including, if the Contract contains an Exhibit 6, that the player pass a physical examination to be conducted by the Team as a condition precedent to the validity of the Contract). Such Contract may not thereafter be amended in any manner for a period of one (1) year.
\item
  After exercising its Right of First Refusal as described in this Section 5, the ROFR Team may not trade the Restricted Free Agent for one (1) year, without the player's consent. Even with the player's consent, for one (1) year, neither the ROFR Team exercising its Right of First Refusal nor any other Team may trade the player to the Team whose Offer Sheet was matched.
\item
  Any Team may condition its First Refusal Exercise Notice on the player reporting for and passing, in the sole discretion of the Team, a physical examination to be conducted by a physician designated by the Team within two (2) days from its exercise of the Right of First Refusal. In connection with the physical examination, the player must supply all information reasonably requested of him, provide complete and truthful answers to all questions posed to him, and submit to all examinations and tests requested of him. In the event the player does not pass the physical examination: (i) the ROFR Team may withdraw its First Refusal Exercise Notice within two (2) days following the date upon which such physical examination is conducted; and (ii) if the First Refusal Exercise Notice is withdrawn, the player and the New Team shall be deemed to have entered into a Player Contract in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(f) above. In the event the player does not submit to the requested physical examination within two (2) days of the exercise of the Right of First Refusal then, until such time as the player submits to the requested physical examination and is notified of the results, the ROFR Team's conditional First Refusal Exercise Notice shall remain in effect, except that the ROFR Team may elect at any time to withdraw its First Refusal Exercise Notice, which shall have the effect of invalidating the Offer Sheet and causing the Team that issued the Offer Sheet to be prohibited from signing or acquiring the player for a period of one (1) year from the date the First Refusal Exercise Notice was withdrawn. If the player does not submit to the requested physical examination on or before March 1, the Offer Sheet shall be deemed invalid and the Team that issued the Offer Sheet shall be prohibited from signing or acquiring the player for a period of one (1) year from such March 1.
\item
  A Team shall not be permitted to exercise its Right of First Refusal pursuant to an agreement to trade the Player Contract to another Team pursuant to Article VII, Section 8(e).
\item
  There may be only one (1) Offer Sheet signed by a Restricted Free Agent outstanding at any one time, provided that the Offer Sheet has also been signed by a Team. An Offer Sheet, both before and after it is given to the ROFR Team, may be revoked or withdrawn only upon the written consent of the ROFR Team, the New Team, and the Restricted Free Agent. In such event, a Restricted Free Agent shall again be free to negotiate and sign an Offer Sheet with any Team, and any Team shall again be free to negotiate and sign an Offer Sheet with such Restricted Free Agent, subject only to the ROFR Team's renewed Right of First Refusal.
\item
  A Team that holds the Right of First Refusal with respect to a Restricted Free Agent may relinquish such Right of First Refusal at any time except during the period that the player has been given to accept a Qualifying Offer. If a Team relinquishes its Right of First Refusal with respect to a Restricted Free Agent, the player shall immediately become an Unrestricted Free Agent and the Team shall be deemed to have renounced the player in accordance with Article VII, Section 4(g) hereof. In order to relinquish its Right of First Refusal with respect to a Restricted Free Agent, a Team shall provide the NBA with a written statement relinquishing such Right of First Refusal. The NBA shall provide a copy of such statement to the Players Association by fax or email within two (2) business days following its receipt thereof.
\item
  An expedited arbitration before the System Arbitrator, whose decision shall be final and binding upon all parties, shall be the exclusive method for resolving any disputes concerning this Section 5. If a dispute arises between the player and either the ROFR Team or the New Team, as the case may be, relating to the contents of an Offer Sheet, and/or whether the binding agreement is between the Restricted Free Agent and the New Team or the Restricted Free Agent and the ROFR Team, such dispute shall immediately be submitted to the System Arbitrator, who shall resolve such dispute within five (5) days.
\item
  A Restricted Free Agent may not give an Offer Sheet to the ROFR Team at any time after the March 1 of the Season for which he has been made a Qualifying Offer.
\item
  On the same day as the giving of an Offer Sheet to the ROFR Team, the ROFR Team shall cause a copy thereof to be given to the NBA, which shall cause a copy thereof to be promptly given to the Players Association. On the same day as the giving of a First Refusal Exercise Notice to the Restricted Free Agent, the ROFR Team shall cause a copy thereof to be given to the New Team, which shall cause a copy thereof to be promptly given to the NBA, which shall cause a copy thereof to be promptly given to the Players Association.
\item
  There may be no consideration of any kind given by one Team to another Team in exchange for a Team's decision to exercise or not to exercise its Right of First Refusal, or in exchange for a Team's decision to submit or not to submit an Offer Sheet to a Restricted Free Agent.
\item
  Any Offer Sheet, First Refusal Exercise Notice, or other writing required or permitted to be given under this Article XI, shall be either by personal delivery or by pre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail addressed as follows:\\
  To any NBA Team: addressed to that Team at the principal address of such Team as then listed on the records of the NBA or at the Team's principal office, to the attention of the Team's general manager;\\
  To the NBA: National Basketball Association, Olympic Tower, 645 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10022, Attn: General Counsel;\\
  To the Players Association: National Basketball Players Association, 310 Lenox Avenue, New York, NY 10027, Attn: Counsel;\\
  To a Restricted Free Agent: (i) for Qualifying Offers and other writings relating to Qualifying Offers (e.g., withdrawal of a Qualifying Offer), to the last known address of the player or his representative; and (ii) for Offer Sheets and other writings relating to Offer Sheets (e.g., First Refusal Exercise Notice), to his address listed on the Offer Sheet, and, if the Restricted Free Agent designates a representative on the Offer Sheet and lists such representative's address thereof, a copy shall be sent to such representative at such address.
\item
  An Offer Sheet shall be deemed given only when received by the ROFR Team. A First Refusal Exercise Notice shall be deemed given when sent by the ROFR Team. A Qualifying Offer, a Maximum Qualifying Offer, an amended Qualifying Offer (i.e., pursuant to Section 4(d) above), and a notice of extension of the date by which a Qualifying Offer can be accepted shall be deemed given when sent by the ROFR Team. Other writings required or permitted to be given under this Article XI (e.g., notice relinquishing a Right of First Refusal, an acceptance of a Qualifying Offer, a withdrawal of a Qualifying Offer, notice that a Qualifying Offer fails to meet one or more of the criteria for a Qualifying Offer, etc.) shall be deemed given only when received by the party to whom it is addressed.

Except as provided by Article VIII, Section 1, a Player Contract shall not contain any option in favor of the Team, except an Option (as defined in Article I, Section 1(nn)) that: (i) is specifically negotiated between a Veteran or a Rookie (other than a First Round Pick) and a Team; (ii) authorizes the extension of such Contract for no more than one (1) year beyond the stated term; (iii) is exercisable only once; and (iv) provides that the Salary (excluding Incentive Compensation), Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses payable with respect to the Option Year are no less than one hundred percent (100\%) of the Salary (excluding Incentive Compensation), Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, payable with respect to the last year of the stated term of such Contract and that all other terms and conditions in the Option Year shall be unchanged from those that applied to the last year of the stated term of such Contract (including, but not limited to, the percentage of Base Compensation that is protected).

A Player Contract shall not contain any option in favor of the player, except:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  an Option that: (i) is specifically negotiated between a Veteran or a Rookie (other than a First Round Pick) and a Team; (ii) authorizes the extension of such Contract for no more than one (1) year beyond the stated term; (iii) is exercisable only once; and (iv) provides that the Salary (excluding Incentive Compensation), Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses payable with respect to the Option Year are no less than one hundred percent (100\%) of the Salary (excluding Incentive Compensation), Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, payable with respect to the last year of the stated term of such Contract and that all other terms and conditions in the Option Year shall be unchanged from those that applied to the last year of the stated term of such Contract (including, but not limited to, the percentage of Base Compensation that is protected). If a Player Contract contains an Option in favor of the player and provides, in whole or in part, for Base Compensation protection in the Option Year, such Contract must also contain, in Exhibit 2 of the Contract under the heading ``Additional Conditions or Limitations,'' either the language set forth in subsection (A) below or the language set forth in subsection (B) below, but not both, and such language shall define the respective rights and obligations of the player and Team with respect to the subject matter thereof:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\Alph{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``If this Contract is terminated by Team prior to Player's exercise of the Option described in Exhibit 1 of the Contract, then Player shall be entitled to benefit from the Base Compensation protection provisions of this Exhibit 2 to the same extent as if the exercise of the Option by Player had occurred prior to Team's termination of the Contract.''
  \item
    ``If this Contract is terminated by Team prior to Player's exercise of the Option described in Exhibit 1 of the Contract, then Team shall be relieved of any obligation to pay Player any Base Compensation with respect to the Option Year.''
  \end{enumerate}

  No Player Contract that contains the language set forth in subsection (B) above may provide for the Option in favor of the player to be exercisable earlier than the day following the date of the Team's last game of the Season prior to the Option Year; and/or
\item
  an Early Termination Option (or ``ETO'') (as defined in Article I, Section 1(s)), provided that such ETO is exercisable only once and takes effect no earlier than the end of the fourth Season of the Contract. A Contract that does not provide for an ETO when signed may not be amended to provide for an ETO during the original term of the Contract. If a Team and a player enter into an Extension (other than an Extension of a Rookie Scale Contract), the Contract may not be amended to provide for an ETO and any previously-existing ETO must be eliminated. If a Team and player enter into an Extension of a Rookie Scale Contract, the Contract may simultaneously be amended to provide for an ETO, provided that such ETO is exercisable only once and takes effect no earlier than the end of the fourth Season of the extended term of the Contract.
\end{enumerate}

If a Contract contains any Option or ETO, the right of the Team or player to exercise such Option or ETO must be fixed at the time the Contract (or Extension) is entered into and may not be contingent upon the satisfaction of any individually-negotiated condition. In the case of an ETO, the Effective Season of such ETO also must be fixed at the time the Contract (or Extension) is entered into and may not be contingent upon the satisfaction of any individually-negotiated condition.

Such an agreement with a sponsor or business partner or third-party may be inferred where: (i) such compensation from the sponsor or business partner or third-party is substantially in excess of the fair market value of any services to be rendered by the player for such sponsor or business partner or third-party; and (ii) the Compensation in the Player Contract between the player and the Team is substantially below the fair market value of such Contract.

If, at the time the Player Contract is terminated, such player would have been an Unrestricted Free Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, he shall immediately become an Unrestricted Free Agent. If, at the time the Player Contract is terminated, such player would have been a Restricted Free Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, such player shall immediately become a Restricted Free Agent upon such termination; however, any such player may choose to reinstate his Player Contract at any time up until September 15 of that year; and
\item
  to recover damages as described in Section 9 below. However, if the player terminates his Player Contract under Section 8(a) above and does not reinstate it pursuant thereto, he may not recover damages for the period after such termination takes effect.

All such meetings shall be in person, shall be held in New York (alternating between the NBA and Players Association offices), and shall be conducted during the month of September following the conclusion of the Season in which the in-game conduct involving another player occurred.
    \item
      In reviewing the fine and/or suspension imposed upon the player by the Commissioner, the Player Discipline Arbitrator shall have authority only to affirm or reduce the financial penalty associated with such fine and/or suspension (including lost salary). The Player Discipline Arbitrator shall have no authority to review financial penalties automatically imposed as a result of technical fouls, ejections, or the violation of other similar NBA rules that result in the imposition of an automatic penalty (such as the ``leaving the bench'' rule).

There shall be a three-member Appeals Panel for each appeal noticed from an award of the System Arbitrator. In the event the Players Association and the NBA cannot agree upon the members of such a panel, the parties will jointly request the CPR Institute (or such other organization(s) as the parties may agree) to submit to the parties a list of fifteen (15) attorneys (none of whom shall have, nor whose firm shall have, represented within the past five (5) years any professional athletes; agents or other representatives of professional athletes; labor organizations representing athletes; sports leagues, governing bodies, or their affiliates; sports teams or their affiliates; or owners in any professional sport). If the parties cannot within seven (7) days from the receipt of such list agree to the identity of the Appeals Panel from among the names on such list, they shall meet and alternate striking one (1) name at a time from the list until three (3) names on the list remain. The three (3) remaining names on the list shall comprise the Appeals Panel. The initial members of the Appeals Panel (however selected) will serve terms ending on the second June 30 following the date of their appointment. On or before June 30, 2013, and on or before each other successive June 30 during the term of this Agreement, either party may discharge one or more members from the Appeals Panel by serving notice on him/her on or before that date and upon the other party to this Agreement, and the discharge shall be effective as of such June 30. A discharged Appeals Panel member may participate in decisions rendered by the Appeals Panel in all cases previously heard to closure of the record, but not participate in the consideration or decision of any other cases. If a member of the Appeals Panel is not discharged as provided above, the member's term will automatically be renewed for an additional year. The compensation of the members of the Appeals Panel and the costs of proceedings before the Appeals Panel shall be borne equally by the parties to this Agreement; provided, however, that each participant in an Appeals Panel proceeding shall bear its own attorneys' fees and litigation costs.

\item
  If the test result for any player is reported by the laboratory as ``invalid'' or ``endogenous steroids abnormally low,'' the NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association, and shall thereafter notify the player. In the event of such a test result, the player shall be required to submit to another test on a date determined by the NBA that is not more than thirty (30) days after the date of the original test (the ``Re-Test''). If the Re-Test results in (i) a positive test for a Drug of Abuse or a positive test under Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above, the player shall be immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below; (ii) a positive test for marijuana, the player shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 8 below; or (iii) a positive test for a SPED or Diuretic, the player shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 below. The original test will not be counted towards the number of tests to be administered to that player for that Season under Section 6 (Random Testing) below.

  In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association has information that gives it reasonable cause to believe that a player is engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, including information that a First-Year Player may have been engaged in such conduct during the period beginning three (3) months prior to his entry into the NBA, such party shall request a conference with the other party and the Independent Expert, which shall be held within twenty-four (24) hours or as soon thereafter as the Expert is available. Upon hearing the information presented, the Independent Expert shall immediately decide whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the player in question has been engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance. If the Independent Expert decides that such reasonable cause exists, the Expert shall thereupon issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to such player.
\item
  In evaluating the information presented to him, the Independent Expert shall use his independent judgment based upon his experience in substance abuse detection and enforcement. The parties acknowledge that the type of information to be presented to the Independent Expert is likely to consist of reports of conversations with third parties of the type generally considered by law enforcement authorities to be reliable sources, and that such sources might not otherwise come forward if their identities were to become known. Accordingly, neither the NBA nor the Players Association shall be required to divulge to each other or to the Independent Expert the names (or other identifying characteristics) of their sources of information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, and the absence of such identification of sources, standing alone, shall not constitute a basis for the Expert to refuse to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to a player. In conferences with the Independent Expert, the player involved shall not be identified by name until such time as the Expert has determined to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to such player in the form set forth in Exhibit I-1 to this Agreement.
\item
  Immediately upon the Independent Expert's issuance of an Authorization for Testing with respect to a particular player, the NBA shall arrange for such player to undergo testing for Drugs of Abuse (if the Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Drug of Abuse), for marijuana (if the authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player's use, possession, or distribution of marijuana), or for SPEDs (if the Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player's use, possession, or distribution of a SPED) no more than four (4) times during the six-week period commencing with the issuance of the Authorization for Testing. Such testing may be administered at any time, in the discretion of the NBA, without prior notice to the player.
\item
  In the event that the player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse pursuant to this Section 5, or tests positive pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above in connection with testing conducted pursuant to this Section 5, he shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below. If the player tests positive for marijuana or a SPED pursuant to this Section 5, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall suffer the applicable consequences of a positive test for the Prohibited Substance for which the Authorization for Testing was issued.
\item
  In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association determines that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that, within the previous year, a player has engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, or has received treatment for use of a Prohibited Substance other than in accordance with the terms of this Article XXXIII, it may, in lieu of requesting the testing procedure set forth in Section 5(a)-(d) above, request a hearing on the matter before the Grievance Arbitrator. If the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that, within the previous year, the Player has used, possessed, or distributed a Prohibited Substance, or has received treatment other than in accordance with the terms of this Article XXXIII, the player shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below, notwithstanding the fact that the player has not undergone the testing procedure set forth in this Section 5; provided, however, that if the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that the player has used or possessed marijuana or a SPED, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may be.

During each Season, the NBA will conduct no more than 1,525 total tests. During the Off-Season, the NBA will conduct no more than 600 total tests. The scheduling of testing and collection of urine samples will be conducted according to a random player selection procedure by a third-party organization, and neither the NBA, the Players Association, any Team or any player will have any involvement in selecting the players to be tested or will receive prior notice of the testing schedule; provided, however, that it shall not be a violation of the foregoing for the third-party organization (or a specimen collector for the same) to provide advance notice of a scheduled collection to an NBA Team Security Representative, so long as such notice does not identify the player(s) who will be tested and seeks merely to facilitate access of the collector to the testing location.

  After a period of at least two (2) years from the time of a player's dismissal and disqualification under Section 11(a) above, and after a period of at least one (1) year from the date of a First-Year Player's dismissal and disqualification under Section 6(b) above, such player may apply for reinstatement as a player in the NBA. However, such player shall have no right to reinstatement under any circumstance and the reinstatement shall be granted only with the prior approval of both the NBA and the Players Association, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The approval of the NBA and the Players Association shall rest in their absolute and sole discretion, and their decision shall be final, binding, and unappealable. Among the factors that may be considered by the NBA and the Players Association in determining whether to grant reinstatement are (without limitation): the circumstances surrounding the player's dismissal and disqualification; whether the player has satisfactorily completed a treatment and rehabilitation program; the player's conduct since his dismissal, including the extent to which the player has since comported himself as a suitable role model for youth; and whether the player is judged to possess the requisite qualities of good character and morality.
\item
  For a First-Year Player, the NBA and the Players Association will consider an application for reinstatement only if the player has, in the opinion of the Medical Director, successfully completed any in-patient treatment and/or aftercare prescribed by the Medical Director. For a Veteran Player, the NBA and the Players Association will consider any application for reinstatement only if the player can demonstrate, by proof of random urine testing acceptable to the Medical Director (conducted on at least a weekly basis), that he has not tested positive (i) for a Prohibited Substance within the twelve (12) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed, and (ii) if the Medical Director deems it necessary in his or her professional judgment, for alcohol for the six (6) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed.
\item
  The granting of an application for reinstatement may be conditioned upon random testing of the player or such other terms as may be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association, whether or not such terms are contemplated by the terms of this Article XXXIII.
\item
  Any player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 and is subsequently dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) above shall therefore be ineligible for reinstatement pursuant to this Section 12.
\item
  In the event that the application for reinstatement of a First-Year Player dismissed and disqualified pursuant to Section 6(b) above is approved, such player, by reason of his Player Contract having been rendered null and void pursuant to Section 6(b) above, shall be deemed not to have completed his Player Contract by rendering the playing services called for thereunder. Accordingly, such player shall not be a Free Agent and shall not be entitled to negotiate or sign a Player Contract with any NBA Team, except as specifically provided in this Section 12.

Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Section 12(f)(ii) below, the previous Team shall then have thirty (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with a stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the event that the Tender is made during a Season, of at least the remainder of that Season) and calling for at least the Minimum Player Salary then applicable to that player but not more than the Salary provided for in Section 12(f)(ii)below. If the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player Contract with the previous Team within the year following such Tender, the player shall thereupon be deemed a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First Refusal. If the previous Team fails to make a Tender, the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.
  \item
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12(f)(i) above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves the notice required by Section 12(f)(i), he is under contract to a professional basketball team not in the NBA, or (B) the player signs a contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA at any point after the date on which the player serves the notice required by Section 12(f)(i) and before the date on which the previous Team makes a Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team that he is immediately available to sign and begin rendering playing services under a Player Contract with such Team, provided that such notice will not be effective until the player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign with and begin rendering playing services for such team.
  \item
    A First-Year Player who is reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 may enter into a Player Contract with his previous Team that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the Player's Salary and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he was dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the previous Team enter into such Player Contract and such Contract covers more than one Season, increases and decreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(c)(1); provided, however, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed and disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale Contract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the player's new Contract may not exceed two (2) Seasons plus two (2) Option Years in favor of the Team, and the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for in any Season of the player's new Contract, including any Option Year, may not exceed the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for during the corresponding Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract contains terms identical to those contained in the remaining Seasons of the Player's Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Team exercises all Option Year(s) available under the new Contract, then the player's Team shall retain the same rights with respect to such new Contract as it would have retained under Article XI following the completion of the player's Rookie Scale Contract.

If the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player Contract with the previous Team within the year following such Tender, then the player shall thereupon be deemed a Restricted or an Unrestricted Free Agent, in accordance with the provisions of Article XI. If the previous Team fails to make a Required Tender, the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.

    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12(g)(i) above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves the notice required by Section 12(g)(i), he is under contract to a professional basketball team not in the NBA, or (B) the player signs a contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA at any point after the date on which he serves the notice required by Section 12(g)(i) and before the date on which the previous Team makes a Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team that he is available to sign a Player Contract with and begin rendering playing services for such Team immediately, provided that such notice will not be effective until the player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign with and begin rendering playing services for such Team.

If the player and the previous Team enter into such Player Contract and such Contract covers more than one (1) Season, increases and decreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(c)(i); provided, however, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed and disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale Contract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the Player's new Contract may not exceed the number of Seasons (including the Option Year in favor of the Team) that remained under the player's Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Salary called for in any Season of the Player's new Contract (including any Option Year), may not exceed the Salary called for during the corresponding Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract contains terms identical to those contained in the remaining Seasons of the player's Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the player's Team ultimately exercises the Option Year available under the new Contract, then such Team shall retain the same rights with respect to such new Contract as it would have retained under Article XI following the completion of the player's Rookie Scale Contract.

  The NBA and the Players Association shall, no later than March 15, 2012, appoint an HGH Testing Panel (the ``HGH Panel''), which shall be comprised of three (3) individuals who shall be experts in the field of testing for performance-enhancing substances. If the NBA and the Players Association are unable to agree on the members of the HGH Panel by the date specified, each shall appoint one (1) expert to the HGH Panel by April 1, 2012, and these two (2) experts shall, by April 15, 2012, appoint the third expert member of the HGH Panel.
\item
  The purpose of the HGH Panel is to determine whether, in its judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players and, if so, to determine the laboratory testing protocols and specimen collection procedures to be implemented in connection with such test. The Panel may use such methods and collect such information as, in its judgment, are necessary and appropriate to make these determinations, and the NBA, the Players Association, NBA Teams, and NBA players shall cooperate fully in this process -- including, with respect to players, by permitting any anonymous baseline testing (by blood testing or otherwise) that the HGH Panel may determine, in its judgment, is necessary and appropriate. (Any such testing shall not result in any penalty for any player.)
\item
  By July 1, 2012, the HGH Panel shall issue a written report to the NBA and the Players Association setting forth its determination as to whether, in its judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players. If the Panel determines that such test does not exist, it shall issue a written report to the parties on each succeeding July 1, setting forth its determination as to whether, in its judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may -- no more than once each year -- request in writing (with a copy to the other side) that the HGH Panel consider developments in the science relating to HGH testing and issue, within three (3) months of such request, a determination as to whether, in its judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players.
\item
  If, pursuant to the foregoing, the HGH Panel determines that there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players and provides written notice to the NBA and the Players Association of the same (which shall include a description of the laboratory testing protocols and specimen collection procedures to be implemented in connection with such testing), the NBA may commence HGH Blood Testing within sixty (60) days thereafter, after notice is provided to NBA players. Such testing may take place under Section 5 (Reasonable Cause Testing), Section 6 (Random Testing) and Section 9 (Steroids, Performance-Enhancing Drugs and Masking Agents) above, and Section 15 (Additional Bases for Testing) below; provided, however, that random HGH Blood Testing pursuant to Section 6 above will occur no more than two (2) times during each Season and no more than one (1) time during each Off-Season. (For clarity, the number of random blood tests for Human Growth Hormone shall be in addition to the number of random urine tests for other Prohibited Substances called for in Section 6 above.) Random HGH blood tests shall occur at the same time that players undergo random urine tests for other SPEDs.

\item
  In addition to any other rights a Team or the NBA may have by contract or by law, if a Force Majeure Event occurs and, as a result, one or more Teams are unable to play one or more games (whether Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff games), then, for each missed Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff game during such period (the ``Force Majeure Period'') that was not rescheduled and replayed, the Compensation payable to each player who was on the roster of a Team that was unable to play one or more games during the Force Majeure Period shall be reduced by 1/94.6th of the player's Compensation for the Season(s) covering the Force Majeure Period. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, and notwithstanding the actual number of games that any Team played, was scheduled to play, or could have played during the Seasons(s) affected by the Force Majeure Event, each Team shall be deemed to play seven (7) Exhibition games, eighty-two (82) Regular Season games, and 5.6 Playoff games during each such Season.

If such Compensation payment (or payments) is (or are) insufficient to cover the Compensation reduction required by Section 5(b) above, then either (i) the player shall promptly pay the difference directly to the Team (``old Team''), or (ii) if he subsequently enters into a Player Contract with, or is traded to, another NBA Team (``new Team''), such difference shall be withheld from the first available Compensation payment (or payments, if the first such payment is insufficient to satisfy the remaining reduction) that is (or are) due to the player from the new Team and shall be remitted by the new Team to the old Team.

  Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event satisfying the terms of Section 5(a) above, the NBA shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as of the sixtieth (60th) day following delivery to the Players Association of a written notice of termination, which must be delivered to the Players Association within sixty (60) days of the Force Majeure Event.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  The Player agrees to observe and comply with all Team rules, as maintained or promulgated in accordance with the CBA, at all times whether on or off the playing floor. Subject to the provisions of the CBA, such rules shall be part of this Contract as fully as if herein written and shall be binding upon the Player.
\item
  The Player agrees: (i) to give his best services, as well as his loyalty, to the Team, and to play basketball only for the Team and its assignees; (ii) to be neatly and fully attired in public; (iii) to conduct himself on and off the court according to the highest standards of honesty, citizenship, and sportsmanship; and (iv) not to do anything that is materially detrimental or materially prejudicial to the best interests of the Team or the League.
\item
  For any violation of Team rules, any breach of any provision of this Contract, or for any conduct impairing the faithful and thorough discharge of the duties incumbent upon the Player, the Team may reasonably impose fines and/or suspensions on the Player in accordance with the terms of the CBA.
\item
  The Player agrees to be bound by Article 35 of the NBA Constitution, a copy of which, as in effect on the date of this Contract, is attached hereto. The Player acknowledges that the Commissioner is empowered to impose fines upon and/or suspend the Player for causes and in the manner provided in such Article, provided that such fines and/or suspensions are consistent with the terms of the CBA.
\item
  The Player agrees that if the Commissioner, in his sole judgment, shall find that the Player has bet, or has offered or attempted to bet, money or anything of value on the outcome of any game participated in by any team which is a member of the NBA, the Commissioner shall have the power in his sole discretion to suspend the Player indefinitely or to expel him as a player for any member of the NBA, and the Commissioner's finding and decision shall be final, binding, conclusive, and unappealable.
\item
  The Player agrees that he will not, during the term of this Contract, directly or indirectly, entice, induce, or persuade, or attempt to entice, induce, or persuade, any player or coach who is under contract to any NBA team to enter into negotiations for or relating to his services as a basketball player or coach, nor shall he negotiate for or contract for such services, except with the prior written consent of such team. Breach of this subparagraph, in addition to the remedies available to the Team, shall be punishable by fine and/or suspension to be imposed by the Commissioner.
\item
  When the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the NBA, he shall be given notice in writing (with a copy to the Players Association), stating the amount of the fine or the duration of the suspension and the reasons therefor.

  In the event the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the NBA, the Team shall withhold the amount of the fine or, in the case of a suspension, the amount provided in Article VI of the CBA from any Current Base Compensation due or to become due to the Player with respect to the contract year in which the conduct resulting in the fine and/or the suspension occurred (or a subsequent contract year if the Player has received all Current Base Compensation due to him for the then current contract year). If, at the time the Player is fined and/or suspended, the Current Base Compensation remaining to be paid to the Player under this Contract is not sufficient to cover such fine and/or suspension, then the Player agrees promptly to pay the amount directly to the Team. In no case shall the Player permit any such fine and/or suspension to be paid on his behalf by anyone other than himself.
\item
  Any Current Base Compensation withheld from or paid by the Player pursuant to this paragraph 6 shall be retained by the Team or the League, as the case may be, unless the Player contests the fine and/or suspension by initiating a timely Grievance in accordance with the provisions of the CBA. If such Grievance is initiated and it satisfies Article XXXI, Section 14 of the CBA, the amount withheld from the Player shall be placed in an interest-bearing account, pursuant to Article XXXI, Section 10 of the CBA, pending the resolution of the Grievance.

\item
  The Player agrees to report at the time and place fixed by the Team in good physical condition and to keep himself throughout each NBA Season in good physical condition.
\item
  If the Player, in the judgment of the Team's physician, is not in good physical condition at the date of his first scheduled game for the Team, or if, at the beginning of or during any Season, he fails to remain in good physical condition (unless such condition results directly from an injury sustained by the Player as a direct result of participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team during such Season), so as to render the Player, in the judgment of the Team's physician, unfit to play skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend such Player until such time as, in the judgment of the Team's physician, the Player is in sufficiently good physical condition to play skilled basketball. In the event of such suspension, the Base Compensation payable to the Player for any Season during such suspension shall be reduced in the same proportion as the length of the period during which, in the judgment of the Team's physician, the Player is unfit to play skilled basketball, bears to the length of such Season. Nothing in this subparagraph shall authorize the Team to suspend the Player solely because the Player is injured or ill.
\item
  If, during the term of this Contract, the Player is injured as a direct result of participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team, the Team will pay the Player's reasonable hospitalization and medical expenses (including doctor's bills), provided that the hospital and doctor are selected by the Team, that the Team shall be obligated to pay only those expenses incurred as a direct result of medical treatment caused solely by and relating directly to the injury sustained by the Player. Subject to the provisions set forth in Exhibit 3, if in the judgment of the Team's physician, the Player's injuries resulted directly from playing for the Team and render him unfit to play skilled basketball, then, so long as such unfitness continues, but in no event after the Player has received his full Base Compensation for the Season in which the injury was sustained, the Team shall pay to the Player the Base Compensation prescribed in Exhibit 1 to this Contract for such Season. The Team's obligations hereunder shall be reduced by (i) any workers' compensation benefits, which, to the extent permitted by law, the Player hereby assigns to the Team, and (ii) any insurance provided for by the Team whether paid or payable to the Player.
\item
  The Player agrees to provide to the Team's coach, trainer, or physician prompt notice of any injury, illness, or medical condition suffered by him that is likely to affect adversely the Player's ability to render the services required under this Contract, including the time, place, cause, and nature of such injury, illness, or condition.
\item
  Should the Player suffer an injury, illness, or medical condition, he will submit himself to a medical examination, appropriate medical treatment by a physician designated by the Team, and such rehabilitation activities as such physician may specify. Such examination when made at the request of the Team shall be at its expense, unless made necessary by some act or conduct of the Player contrary to the terms of this Contract.
\item
  The Player agrees (i) to submit to a physical examination at the commencement and conclusion of each Contract year hereunder, and at such other times as reasonably determined by the Team to be medically necessary, and (ii) at the commencement of this Contract, and upon the request of the Team, to provide a complete prior medical history.
\item
  The Player agrees to supply complete and truthful information in connection with any medical examinations or requests for medical information authorized by this Contract.
\item
  A Player who consults or is treated by a physician (including a psychiatrist) or a professional providing non-mental health related medical services (e.g., chiropractor, physical therapist) other than a physician or other professional designated by the Team shall give notice of such consultation or treatment to the Team and shall authorize and direct such other physician or professional to provide the Team with all information it may request concerning any condition that in the judgment of the Team's physician may affect the Player's ability to play skilled basketball.
\item
  If and to the extent necessary to enable or facilitate the disclosure of medical information as provided for by this Contract or Article XXII or XXXIII of the CBA, the Player shall execute such individual authorization(s) as may be requested by the Team or the Medical Director of the Anti-Drug Program or as may be required by health care providers who examine or treat the Player.

  \textbf{PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES.}

  The Player acknowledges that this Contract may be terminated in accordance with the express provisions of Article XXXIII (Anti-Drug Program) of the CBA, and that any such termination will result in the Player's immediate dismissal and disqualification from any employment by the NBA and any of its teams. Notwithstanding any terms or provisions of this Contract (including any amendments hereto), in the event of such termination, all obligations of the Team, including obligations to pay Compensation, shall cease, except the obligation of the Team to pay the Player's earned Compensation (whether Current or Deferred) to the date of termination.
\item
  \textbf{UNIQUE SKILLS.}

  The Player represents and agrees that he has extraordinary and unique skill and ability as a basketball player, that the services to be rendered by him hereunder cannot be replaced or the loss thereof adequately compensated for in money damages, and that any breach by the Player of this Contract will cause irreparable injury to the Team, and to its assignees. Therefore, it is agreed that in the event it is alleged by the Team that the Player is playing, attempting or threatening to play, or negotiating for the purpose of playing, during the term of this Contract, for any other person, firm, entity, or organization, the Team and its assignees (in addition to any other remedies that may be available to them judicially or by way of arbitration) shall have the right to obtain from any court or arbitrator having jurisdiction such equitable relief as may be appropriate, including a decree enjoining the Player from any further such breach of this Contract, and enjoining the Player from playing basketball for any other person, firm, entity, or organization during the term of this Contract. The Player agrees that this right may be enforced by the Team or the NBA. In any suit, action, or arbitration proceeding brought to obtain such equitable relief, the Player does hereby waive his right, if any, to trial by jury, and does hereby waive his right, if any, to interpose any counterclaim or set-off for any cause whatever.

  In the event that this Contract is assigned to any other NBA team, all reasonable expenses incurred by the Player in moving himself and his family to the home territory of the team to which such assignment is made, as a result thereof, shall be paid by the assignee team.
\item
  In the event that this Contract is assigned to another NBA team, the Player shall forthwith be provided notice orally or in writing, delivered to the Player personally or delivered or mailed to his last known address, and the Player shall report to the assignee team within forty-eight (48) hours after said notice has been received (if the assignment is made during a Season), within one (1) week after said notice has been received (if the assignment is made between Seasons), or within such longer time for reporting as may be specified in said notice. The NBA shall also promptly notify the Players Association of any such assignment. The Player further agrees that, immediately upon reporting to the assignee team, he will submit upon request to a physical examination conducted by a physician designated by the assignee team.
\item
  If the Player, without a reasonable excuse, does not report to the team to which this Contract has been assigned within the time provided in subsection (c) above, then (i) upon consummation of the assignment, the Player may be disciplined by the assignee team or, if the assignment is not consummated or is voided as a result of the Player's failure to so report, bythe assignor Team, and (ii) such conduct shall constitute conduct prejudicial to the NBA under Article 35(d) of the NBA Constitution, and shall therefore subject the Player to discipline from the NBA in accordance with such Article.

Accordingly, the Player agrees that he will not, without the written consent of the Team, engage in any activity that a reasonable person would recognize as involving or exposing the participant to a substantial risk of bodily injury including, but not limited to: (i) sky-diving, hang gliding, snow skiing, rock or mountain climbing (as distinguished from hiking), rappelling, and bungee jumping; (ii) any fighting, boxing, or wrestling; (iii) driving or riding on a motorcycle or moped; (iv) riding in or on any motorized vehicle in any kind of race or racing contest; (v) operating an aircraft of any kind; (vi) engaging in any other activity excluded or prohibited by or under any insurance policy which the Team procures against the injury, illness or disability to or of the Player, or death of the Player, for which the Player has received written notice from the Team prior to the execution of this Contract; or (vii) participating in any game or exhibition of basketball, football, baseball, hockey, lacrosse, or other team sport or competition. If the Player violates this Paragraph 12, he shall be subject to discipline imposed by the Team and/or the Commissioner of the NBA. Nothing contained herein shall be intended to require the Player to obtain the written consent of the Team in order to enable the Player to participate in, as an amateur, the sports of golf, tennis, handball, swimming, hiking, softball, volleyball, and other similar sports that a reasonable person would not recognize as involving or exposing the participant to a substantial risk of bodily injury.

  \item
    Each Member shall provide and require in every contract with any of its Players that they shall be bound and governed by the provisions of this Article. Each Member, at the direction of the Board of Governors or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall take such action as the Board or the Commissioner may direct in order to effectuate the purposes of this Article.
  \item
    The Commissioner shall direct the dismissal and perpetual disqualification from any further association with the Association or any of its Members, of any Player found by the Commissioner after a hearing to have been guilty of offering, agreeing, conspiring, aiding or attempting to cause any game of basketball to result otherwise than on its merits.
  \item
    If in the opinion of the Commissioner any act or conduct of a Player at or during an Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff game has been prejudicial to or against the best interests of the Association or the game of basketball, the Commissioner shall impose upon such Player a fine not exceeding \$50,000, or may order for a time the suspension of any such Player from any connection or duties with Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff games, or he may order both such fine and suspension.
  \item
    The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding \$50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any Player who, in his opinion, (i) shall have made or caused to be made any statement having, or that was designed to have, an effect prejudicial or detrimental to the best interests of basketball or of the Association or of a Member, or (ii) shall have been guilty of conduct that does not conform to standards of morality or fair play, that does not comply at all times with all federal, state, and local laws, or that is prejudicial or detrimental to the Association.
  \item
    Any Player who, directly or indirectly, entices, induces, persuades or attempts to entice, induce, or persuade any Player, Coach, Trainer,General Manager or any other person who is under contract to any other Member of the Association to enter into negotiations for or relating to his services or negotiates or contracts for such services shall, on being charged with such tampering, be given an opportunity to answer such charges after due notice and the Commissioner shall have the power to decide whether or not the charges have been sustained; in the event his decision is that the charges have been sustained, then the Commissioner shall have the power to suspend such Player for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding \$50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any such Player.
  \item
    Any Player who, directly or indirectly, wagers money or anything of value on the outcome of any game played by a Team in the league operated by the Association shall, on being charged with such wagering, be given an opportunity to answer such charges after due notice, and the decision of the Commissioner shall be final, binding and conclusive and unappealable. The penalty for such offense shall be within the absolute and sole discretion of the Commissioner and may include a fine, suspension, expulsion and/or perpetual disqualification from further association with the Association or any of its Members.

\subsubsection{EXCERPT FROM NBA BY-LAWS}\label{excerpt-from-nba-by-laws}}

5.01. \emph{Waiver Right.} Except for sales and trading between Members in accordance with these By-Laws, no Member shall sell, option, or otherwise assign the contract with, right to the services of, or right to negotiate with, a Player without complying with the waiver procedure prescribed by this Constitution and By-Laws.

5.02. \emph{Waiver Price.} The waiver price shall be \$1,000 per Player.

5.03. \emph{Waiver Procedure.} A Member desiring to secure waivers on a Player shall notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee, who shall, on behalf of such Member, immediately notify all other Members of the waiver request. Such Player shall be assumed to have been waived unless a Member shall notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee in accordance with Section 5.04 of a claim to the rights to such Player. Once a Member has notified the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee of its desire to secure waivers on a Player, such notice may not be withdrawn. A Player remains the financial responsibility of the Member placing him on waivers until the waiver period set by the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee has expired.

5.04. \emph{Waiver Period.} If the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee distributes notice of request for waiver, any Members wishing to claim rights to the Player shall do so by giving notice by telephone and in a Writing of such claim to the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee within forty-eight (48) hours after the time of such notice. A Team may not withdraw a claim to the rights to a Player on waivers. Notwithstanding Article 40 of the NBA Constitution, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be included when computing the above-referenced waiver period.

5.05. \emph{Waiver Preferences.}
(a) In the event that more than one (1) Member shall have claimed the rights to a Player placed on waivers, the claiming Member with the lowest team standing at the time the waiver was requested shall be entitled to acquire the rights to such Player. If the request for waiver shall occur after the last day of the Season and before 11:59 p.m. eastern time on the following November 30, the standings at the close of the previous Season shall govern.
(b) If the winning percentage of two (2) claiming Teams are the same, then the tie shall be determined, if possible, on the basis of the Regular Season Games between the two (2) Teams during the Season or during the preceding Season, as the case may be. If still tied, a toss of a coin shall determine priority. For the purpose of determining standings, both Conferences of the Association shall be deemed merged and a consolidated standing shall control.

5.06. \emph{Players Acquired Through Waivers.} A Member who has acquired the rights and title to the contract of a Player through the waiver procedure may not sell or trade such rights for a period of thirty (30) days after the acquisition thereof; provided, however, that if the rights to such Player were acquired between Seasons, the 30-day period described herein shall begin on the first day of the next succeeding Season.

5.07. \emph{Additional Waiver Rules.} The Commissioner or the Board of Governors may from time to time adopt additional rules (supplementary to those set forth in this Section 5) with respect to the operation of the waiver procedure. Such rules shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 5 and shall apply to but shall not be limited to the mechanics of notice, inadvertent omission of notification to a Member, and rules of construction as to time.

If the Player, in the reasonable judgment of the physician designated for that purpose by the Team, is not in good physical condition at the date of his first scheduled game for the Team, or if, at the beginning of or during any Season, he fails to remain in good physical condition, in either event so as to render the Player unfit in the reasonable judgment of said physician to play skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend the Player for successive one-week periods until the Player, in the reasonable judgment of the Team's physician, is in good physical condition; provided, however, that at the end of each such one-week period of suspension, if the Team notifies the Player, orally or in writing, that in its reasonable judgment it believes the Player is still not in good physical condition, and if the Player so requests, then the Player shall be examined by a physician or physicians designated for such purpose by the President, or any Vice President if the President is not available, of the American Society of Orthopedic Physicians, or equivalent organization (the''Reviewing Physician''), whose sole judgment concerning the physical condition of the Player to play skilled basketball shall be binding upon the Team and the Player for purposes of this paragraph. The suspension of the Player shall be terminated promptly upon the failure of the Team to give the Player the notice required at the end of the one-week period or upon the finding of said Reviewing Physician that the Player is in physical condition sufficient to play skilled basketball. In the event of a suspension permitted hereunder, the Compensation (excluding any signing bonus or Incentive Compensation) payable to the Player for any Season during such suspension shall be reduced in the same proportion as the length of the period of disability so determined bears to the length of the Season. Nothing in this paragraph 7(b) shall authorize the Team to suspend the Player solely because the Player is injured or ill.''

The Player's right to receive any Compensation under this Contract (other than Compensation in accordance with paragraph 3(b)) is eliminated in the event the Contract is terminated prior to the first day of the Regular Season covered by the Contract; provided, however, that if the Player is injured as a direct result of playing for the Team and, accordingly, would have been entitled (but for this Exhibit 9) to Compensation pursuant to paragraphs 7(c), 16(a)(iii), 16(b), or otherwise, the Team's sole liability shall be to pay the Player \$6,000 upon termination of the Player's Contract.

\section{URINE COLLECTION PROCEDURES}\label{urine-collection-procedures}}

When the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure that the player is positively identified through presentation of photo ID or identification by a team representative. If the player's identity cannot be established, the collector shall not proceed with the collection.

The player will be asked to select a sealed urine specimen cup. The player will then provide his urine specimen under the direct observation of the collector.

The collector shall ensure that the player has provided a urine specimen of sufficient volume for accurate testing. If such a sample cannot immediately be provided by the player, he shall be instructed to remain at the testing site for a reasonable period of time until he can provide such a specimen. Once the specimen has been obtained, the player will select a sealed specimen kit, which contains two bottles. The collector, in the presence of the player, will pour the specimen into two bottles. One bottle will be used as the primary or ``A'' specimen and the other will be used as the split or ``B'' specimen. The specimen bottles will be sealed with tamper-proof seals in the presence of the player. The seals will contain a unique identification number that corresponds to the number on the chain of custody form.

The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form (which may be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the handling of the specimen. The collector will note any irregularities concerning the specimen on the chain of custody form. Both the player and collector will sign the chain of custody form. The kit will be sealed and sent via overnight courier to the laboratory for testing. If a hard copy chain-of-custody form is used, it will be included in the kit containing the two specimens that is sent by overnight courier to the laboratory. If an electronic chain-of-custody form is used, it will be sent to the laboratory electronically.

Once the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will be analyzed. If the primary specimen tests positive, the split sample will be placed in frozen storage and will be available for testing by a different laboratory, if requested by the player.

{[}Date{]}

National Basketball Players Association\\
310 Lenox Avenue\\
New York, NY 10027

Re: Confidentiality Agreement

Gentlemen:

This will confirm the agreement of the National Basketball Players Association (``Players Association'') (on behalf of itself and its employees, officers and outside advisors) to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information (as defined in Paragraph 6 below) in connection with the audit, with respect to the 20\_\_-20\_\_ Salary Cap Year, of (i) the National Basketball Association (``NBA'') League Office, (ii) any NBA team that the parties agree is to be included in such audit with respect to such Salary Cap Year (the ``Team(s)''), and (iii) the expenses incurred in connection with proceeds that come within Article VII, Section 1(a)(1)(viii) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (``CBA'') entered into July 29, 2005, between the Players Association and the NBA (collectively, the ``Audit''). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the CBA.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The NBA and the Team(s) shall make available Confidential Information for purposes of the Audit based on the representation of the Players Association that it (and its employees, officers and outside advisors) shall comply with the terms of this Confidentiality Agreement at all times during and after the Audit. To that end, before any employee, officer or outside advisor of the Players Association may be permitted to review any Confidential Information, the Players Association shall require such employee, officer or outside advisor to agree, in writing (in the form of acknowledgment annexed hereto), to comply with the terms of this Confidentiality Agreement, and the Players Association shall promptly provide copies thereof to the NBA.
\item
  The Players Association shall maintain the absolute confidentiality of all Confidential Information at all times and shall not disclose to any person or entity, except as permitted herein, any Confidential Information. The Players Association agrees that it may use or refer to Confidential Information only during the course of the Audit and solely for the purpose of conducting the Audit in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CBA and this Confidentiality Agreement, and that Confidential Information may not be used or referred to by the Players Association (or any of its employees, officers and outside advisors), at any time, for any purpose other than to conduct the Audit in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CBA and this Confidentiality Agreement. The Players Association (and its employees, officers, NBA team player representatives (``Player Representatives'') and outside advisors) shall not disclose, disseminate or provide any Confidential Information to any other person or entity (including NBA players who are not officers of, or Player Representatives for, the Players Association and any representative of any player), at any time, for any purpose; provided, however, that the Players Association may only disclose, disseminate or provide a summary of Confidential Information to Player Representatives in aggregate form without identifying any specific information (e.g., by sponsor). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Confidentiality Agreement, the Players Association shall not be deemed to have violated any provision herein if the Players Association discloses to such third party that the Audit is being undertaken and that the Players Association is subject to a confidentiality agreement and, therefore, not permitted to discuss the Audit. The foregoing shall not foreclose the Players Association from disclosing Confidential Information during the course of a proceeding before the System Arbitrator, an appeal to the Appeals Panel of an award of the System Arbitrator and a judicial action to enforce any such proceeding or award.
\item
  The Players Association shall adopt and implement such procedures to insure the confidentiality of Confidential Information as would be employed by a reasonable and prudent person to safeguard the confidentiality of his or her own most confidential information, or, if more stringent, such procedures as are employed for such purposes by the Players Association. Such procedures shall include, but not be limited to,steps to insure that such Confidential Information is disclosed only to those Players Association employees and officers and, subject to the restrictions set forth in Paragraph 2 above, Player Representatives who have a need to have access to such Confidential Information and only for the purpose of conducting the Audit in accordance with the terms of the CBA and this Confidentiality Agreement. The foregoing shall not foreclose the Players Association from disclosing Confidential Information during the course of a proceeding before the System Arbitrator, an appeal to the Appeals Panel of an award of the System Arbitrator and a judicial action to enforce any such proceeding or award.
\item
  The Players Association agrees that no copies of Confidential Information made available by the NBA and the Team(s) may be removed from the NBA's or the Team(s)' offices (as applicable).
\item
  If the Players Association is required by governmental or judicial authorities (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall provide the NBA and/or the Team(s) with prompt notice so that the NBA and/or the Team(s) may seek an appropriate protective order. If, in the absence of a protective order, the Players Association is, after giving notice in accordance with the preceding sentence, compelled to disclose Confidential Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the Players Association may disclose only such Confidential Information as is necessary to avoid such liability without incurring liability hereunder.
\item
  For purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement, ``Confidential Information'' shall mean all documents, materials and other information reviewed or made available (whether in written or oral form) in connection with the Audit (including, without limitation, all documents, materials and other information made available by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP), and shall include all excerpts, extracts, summaries and contents thereof and notes taken during the Audit; provided, however that Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Players Association (including Players Association affiliates or representatives), (b) was available to the Players Association prior to its disclosure by the NBA or the Team(s) (as applicable), or (c) becomes available to the Players Association from a source other than the NBA or the Team(s), provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the NBA, the Team(s) or the Players Association.
\item
  The Players Association acknowledges that the terms and conditions contained in this Confidentiality Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the NBA and the Team(s), do not cause the Players Association undue hardship, and that any violation of the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement or disclosure of any Confidential Information without the NBA's or the Team(s)' (as applicable) prior written consent will result in irreparable injury to the NBA and/or the Team(s) for which there is no adequate remedy. Accordingly, in the event of any such violation or disclosure, the NBA and/or the Team(s) shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief from any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in New York, New York, and the Players Association hereby consents to, and waives any objection to, venue and jurisdiction in such courts. In addition, the Players Association shall indemnify and hold harmless the NBA and its member teams and their respective affiliates, owners, directors, governors, officers and employees, and the successors, assigns and personal representatives of the foregoing parties (``NBA indemnified parties''), from and against all liability, damages and costs (including attorneys fees) arising out of any claim asserted against any NBA indemnified party relating to any use or disclosure of Confidential Information by, or the violation of this Confidentiality Agreement by, the Players Association (or any of its employees, officers, Player Representatives and outside advisors), provided that: (a) the Players Association is given prompt notice of any such claim; (b) the Players Association has the right to approve counsel and/or has the opportunity to undertake the defense of such claim; and (c) the indemnified party does not admit liability with respect to and does not settle such claim without the prior written consent of the Players Association. The Players Association also agrees that the relief provided for in this Paragraph 7 shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the NBA and the Team(s) may be entitled.
\item
  This Confidentiality Agreement is the final and complete agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. Any waiver of or modification to this Confidentiality Agreement must be in a writing and signed by each party. Any waiver in any particular instance of the rights and limitations contained herein shall not be deemed and is not intended to be a general waiver of any rights or limitations contained herein and shall not operate as a waiver beyond the particular instance.
\item
  This Confidentiality Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.
\end{enumerate}

If the foregoing coincides with your understanding of our agreement, please sign the enclosed copy of this letter and return it to me.
