## NBADL Work Assignments.

(a) With respect to the 2011-12 NBA Season, an NBA Team may at any time assign a player on its Active List or Inactive List to an NBA Development League ("NBADL") team, provided that the player (i) has either zero (0) or one (1) Years of Service at the time of the assignment, or (ii) has more than one (1) year of service at the time of the assignment and the player and the Players Association consent to such assignment in writing. With respect to the 2012-13 through 2021-22 NBA Seasons, an NBA Team may at any time assign a player on its Active List or Inactive List to an NBADL team, provided that the player (i) has either zero (0), one (1) or two (2) Years of Service at the time of the assignment, or (ii) has more than two (2) years of service at the time of the assignment and the player and the Players Association consent to such assignment in writing. Upon such assignment ("NBADL Work Assignment"), the player will be placed on the NBA Team's Inactive List, and shall (i) report to the NBADL team (and render for the NBADL team such services as the player is required to render for the NBA Team under his Uniform Player Contract and this Agreement), and (ii) at the direction of the NBA Team, subsequently return and report to, and resume the performance of services for, the NBA Team. An NBADL Work Assignment commences when the player reports in-person to the NBADL team, and ends either when the player, upon being recalled, reports back to his NBA Team or when the NBADL season concludes.
(b) No player shall be given more than three (3) NBADL Work Assignments during the 2011-12 NBA Season. There shall be no limit on the number of NBADL Work Assignments given to a player in any subsequent Season during the 2012-13 through 2020-21 NBA Seasons. No NBA Team shall issue an NBADL Work Assignment for the purpose of disciplining a player for misconduct or retaliating against a player for exercising any right that he has under this Agreement or the Uniform Player Contract.
(c) The NBA may establish reasonable rules regarding the assignment and recall of players to the NBADL provided that such rules do not violate the provisions of this Article XLI.

## Reporting Requirements for NBADL Work Assignments.

(a) In order to initiate an NBADL Work Assignment or terminate such assignment and recall the player, the NBA Team shall provide the player, the NBA, and the Players Association with written notice. The player shall report to the NBADL team or NBA Team, whichever is applicable, within forty-eight (48) hours after such notice is received by the player.
(b) If the player, without a reasonable excuse, does not report to the NBADL team or NBA Team, whichever is applicable, within the time provided in Section 2(a) above, the player may be fined and/or suspended without pay by the NBA Team until such time as he reports. In addition, such failure to report, without a reasonable excuse, shall constitute conduct prejudicial to the NBA under Article 35(d) of the NBA Constitution.

## Travel and Relocation Expenses.

A player's NBA Team shall be obligated to reimburse the player for his ordinary and reasonable expenses incurred in (a) traveling to and, when recalled, from the NBADL team to begin and/or end any NBADL Work Assignment, and (b) relocating to and, if recalled, from the NBADL team's home location to begin and/or end any NBADL Work Assignment that extends beyond a period of thirty (30) days. During any NBADL Work Assignment, the player will be provided with housing or a housing subsidy in accordance with the NBADL housing policy.

For purposes of paragraph 16(a)(ii) of a player's Uniform Player Contract, during or in connection with any NBADL Work Assignment, (A) the terms "any official or employee of the Team or the NBA (other than another player)" will be construed to include, without limitation, any official or employee of the NBADL or the player's NBADL team (other than another player), and (B) the terms "any NBA game or event" will be construed to include, without limitation, any NBADL game or event.
