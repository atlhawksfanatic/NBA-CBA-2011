Year of the Rookie Scale Contract ("Fourth Year Salary")
increased by the percentage called for in Exhibit B hereto;
provided that:
(A) For any First Round Pick finishing his Rookie Scale
Contract who was not selected with one of the first
nine (9) picks in the Draft and who, (1) during the

percent (120%) of the Rookie Scale Amount
applicable to the ninth player.
(B) For any First Round Pick finishing his Rookie Scale

through fourteenth picks in the Draft and who failed
to meet the Starter Criteria, the player's Qualifying

the fifteenth player shall be deemed to equal one
hundred twenty percent (120%) of the Rookie Scale
Amount applicable to the fifteenth player.
(iii) For all other players subject to a Right of First Refusal in
accordance with this Article XI, the Salary (excluding
Incentive Compensation), Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely
Bonuses contained in a Qualifying Offer shall be the
greater of
(W) One hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the

Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively,
for the last Salary Cap Year covered by the player's
prior Contract, or(X) Base Compensation equal to the sum of the
Minimum Annual Salary applicable to the player (for
the Season covered by the Qualifying Offer) plus
\$200,000 (with no bonuses of any kind);
provided that, for any second round pick or undrafted
player with two (2) or three (3) Years of Service who met
the Starter Criteria in respect of the prior two (2) Seasons
of his Contract (i.e. who either averaged the games started
or minutes played amounts described in Section
1(c)(ii)(A)(1) above during his prior two (2) seasons, or
achieved the games started or minutes played amounts
described in Section 1(c)(ii)(A)(2) above in his prior Season
only), the Qualifying Offer shall instead contain, if such
amount exceeds the greater of the amounts described in
(W) or (X) above, Base Compensation equal to the amount
of the Qualifying Offer applicable to the twenty-first player
selected in the first round of the Draft (the "twenty-first
player") as called for by the Rookie Salary Scale applicable
to Rookie Scale Contracts finishing in the same Season as
the last Season of the player's Contract. For purposes of

one hundred percent (100%) of the Rookie Scale Amount
applicable to the twenty-first player.
(iv) All other terms and conditions in a Qualifying Offer must
be unchanged from those that applied to the last year of
the player's prior Contract to the extent that such terms
and conditions are allowable amendments under this
Agreement at the time the Qualifying Offer is made. In
addition, a Team shall be permitted to include in any
Qualifying Offer an Exhibit 6 to the Uniform Player
Contract requiring that the player, if he signs the Qualifying
Offer, pass a physical examination to be performed by a
physician designated by the Team as a condition precedent
to the validity of the Contract. For purposes of the
foregoing, the Starter Criteria shall be determined based
upon Official NBA statistics.Section 2. No Individually-Negotiated Right of First Refusal.
(a) No Player Contract, or any Renegotiation, Extension, or other
amendment of a Player Contract, executed after the date of this
Agreement, may include any individually-negotiated Right of First Refusal
or other limitation on player movement following the last Salary Cap Year
covered by such Player Contract.
(b) No Right of First Refusal rule, practice, policy, regulation, or
agreement providing for a Right of First Refusal shall be applied to any
player as a result of that player's entry into a player contract with or the

NBA.
Section 3. Withholding Services.
A player who withholds playing services called for by a Player Contract
for more than thirty (30) days after the start of the last Season covered by
his Player Contract shall be deemed not to have "complet[ed] his Player
Contract by rendering the playing services called for thereunder."
Accordingly, such a player shall not be a Veteran Free Agent and shall not
be entitled to negotiate or sign a Player Contract with any other
professional basketball team unless and until the Team for which the
player last played expressly agrees otherwise.
Section 4. Qualifying Offers to Make Certain Players Restricted
Free Agents.
(a) (i) From the day following the Season covered by the second
Option Year of a First Round Pick's Rookie Scale Contract
through the immediately following June 30, the player's
Team may make a Qualifying Offer to the player. If such a
Qualifying Offer is made, then, on the July 1 following
such Season, the player shall become a Restricted Free
Agent, subject to a Right of First Refusal in favor of the
Team ("ROFR Team"), as set forth in Section 5 below. If
such a Qualifying Offer is not made, then the player shall
become an Unrestricted Free Agent on such July 1. If a
Team does not timely exercise its Option with respect to
the first Option Year or second Option Year of a player's
Rookie Scale Contract in accordance with Article VIII, theplayer shall, following his second or third Season (as the
case may be) become an Unrestricted Free Agent.
(ii) A Team that makes a Qualifying Offer to a player
following the second Option Year of his Rookie Scale
Contract may elect simultaneously to offer the player an
alternative Contract covering five (5) Seasons that provides
Salary for the first Salary Cap Year equal to the Maximum
Annual Salary under Article II, Section 7(a), with annual
increases in Salary equal to seven and one-half percent
(7.5%) of the Salary for the first Salary Cap Year (a
"Maximum Qualifying Offer"). Providing a player with a
Maximum Qualifying Offer shall have the consequence
described in Section 5(b) below. A Maximum Qualifying
Offer shall be subject to the following:
(A) A Maximum Qualifying Offer shall contain only Base
Compensation and no bonuses of any kind.
(B) A Maximum Qualifying Offer shall state that the
player's Base Compensation for the first Season shall
equal "the Maximum Annual Salary applicable to the
player in the first Season of the Contract," and that
the Base Compensation in each of the four (4)
subsequent Seasons shall "be increased by seven and
one-half percent (7.5%) of the Base Compensation
for the first Season." Such a Contract, if timely
accepted by the player in accordance with Section
4(a)(ii)(D) below, shall be deemed amended to
provide for specific Base Compensation for each
Season covered by the Contract, based on the
Maximum Annual Salary applicable to the player in
the first Season.
(C) A Maximum Qualifying Offer cannot contain an
Option or ETO, and must provide full Base
Compensation protection in each Season for lack of
skill and injury or illness (with no individually-
negotiated conditions or limitations on such
protection).(D) The Team's offer of a Maximum Qualifying Offer
must remain open for the same period that the
player's Qualifying Offer remains open and cannot be
withdrawn, except that if the Team withdraws its
Qualifying Offer, the Maximum Qualifying Offer
shall be deemed to be withdrawn simultaneously.
(E) A player may accept either his Qualifying Offer or his
Maximum Qualifying Offer, but not both.
(b) Any Veteran Free Agent (other than a First Round Pick whose first
Option Year or second Option Year was not exercised) who will have
three (3) or fewer Years of Service as of the June 30 following the end of
the last Season covered by his Player Contract will be a Restricted Free
Agent if his Prior Team makes a Qualifying Offer to the player at any time
from the day following such Season through the immediately following
June 30. If such a Qualifying Offer is made, then, on the July 1 following
the last Season covered by the player's Player Contract, the player shall
become a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First Refusal in
favor of the Team ("ROFR Team"), as set forth in Section 5 below. If
such a Qualifying Offer is not made, then the player shall become an
Unrestricted Free Agent on such July 1.
(c) (i) A player who receives a Qualifying Offer must be given
until the October 1 following its issuance to accept it.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Qualifying
Offer may be withdrawn by the Team at any time through
the July 23 following its issuance. If the Qualifying Offer is
not withdrawn on or before July 23, it may be withdrawn
thereafter but only if the player agrees in writing to the
withdrawal. If a Qualifying Offer is withdrawn, the player
shall immediately become an Unrestricted Free Agent. If a
Qualifying Offer is withdrawn on or after July 24, the
Team also shall be deemed to have renounced the player in
accordance with Article VII, Section 4(g). A player may
not accept a Qualifying Offer after the October 1 following
the issuance thereof, unless the Team, prior to October 1,
extends the date by which the player may accept the
Qualifying Offer. In order to extend the date by which a
player may accept his Qualifying Offer, a Team shallprovide the player with written notice of the extension,
which shall be either personally delivered to the player or
his representative or sent by pre-paid certified, registered,
or overnight mail to the last known address of the player or
his representative. In no event may the acceptance date for
a Qualifying Offer be extended beyond, or may a player
accept a Qualifying Offer beyond, the March 1 following
its issuance.
(ii) If a Qualifying Offer is neither withdrawn nor accepted
and the deadline for accepting it passes, the Team's Right
of First Refusal shall continue, subject to Section 5(a)
below.
(iii) A player who knows that he has a physical disability that
would render him physically unable to perform the playing
services required under a Player Contract the following
Season may not validly accept a Qualifying Offer received
under this Section 4 or Section 5 below, unless the ROFR
Team consents after disclosure of such physical disability.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, a
player who knows that he has a physical disability that
would render him physically unable to perform the playing
services required under a Player Contract the following
Season remains subject to the ROFR Team's Right of First
Refusal.
(d) Any claim that a Contract offered as a Qualifying Offer or a
Maximum Qualifying Offer fails to meet one or more of the criteria for a
Qualifying Offer or a Maximum Qualifying Offer shall be made by notice
to the Team, in writing, no later than ten (10) days after a copy of the
Qualifying Offer or Maximum Qualifying Offer was given by the Team or
the NBA to the Players Association. Such notice must set forth the
specific changes that allegedly must be made to the offered Contract in
order for it to constitute a Qualifying Offer or a Maximum Qualifying
Offer. Upon receipt of such notice, if the requested changes are necessary
to satisfy the requirements of a Qualifying Offer or a Maximum Qualifying
Offer, the Team may, within five (5) business days, offer the player an
amended Contract incorporating the requested changes. If the Team
offers such an amended Contract, the player and the Players Associationshall be precluded from asserting that such Contract does not constitute a
timely and valid Qualifying Offer or Maximum Qualifying Offer.
Section 5. Restricted Free Agency.
(a) If a Restricted Free Agent does not sign an Offer Sheet with any
Team by March 1 of the Season for which the Qualifying Offer is made,
and does not sign a Player Contract with the ROFR Team before that
Season ends, then his ROFR Team may reassert its Right of First Refusal
for the following Season by extending another Qualifying Offer (with the
same terms, including the amount of Salary (excluding Incentive
Compensation), Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, that
were included in the prior Qualifying Offer) on or before the next June 30.
A ROFR Team may continue to reassert its Right of First Refusal by
following the foregoing procedure in each subsequent year in which that
Restricted Free Agent does not sign an Offer Sheet with any Team by
March 1 of the Season for which the Qualifying Offer is made, and does
not sign a Player Contract with the ROFR Team before that Season ends.
In each Season in which a Team reasserts its Right of First Refusal by
extending another Qualifying Offer in accordance with this Section 5(a),
the Team may also elect to simultaneously provide the player with a
Maximum Qualifying Offer (with the same terms that were included in the
prior Maximum Qualifying Offer). Any such Qualifying Offer and
Maximum Qualifying Offer shall be governed by the provisions of Section
4 above.
(b) When a Restricted Free Agent receives an offer to sign a Player
Contract from a Team other than the ROFR Team (the "New Team"),
which he desires to accept, he shall give to the ROFR Team a completed
certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G annexed hereto (the
"Offer Sheet"), signed by the Restricted Free Agent and the New Team,
which shall have attached to it a Uniform Player Contract separately
specifying: (i) the "Principal Terms" (as defined in Section 5(d) below) of
the New Team's offer; and (ii) any non-Principal Terms of the New
Team's offer that the ROFR Team is not required to match (as specified in
Section 5(d) below) but which would be included in the player's Player
Contract with the New Team if the ROFR Team does not exercise its
Right of First Refusal. The Offer Sheet must be for a Player Contract with
a term of more than one (1) season (not including any Option Year),
unless the ROFR team has tendered the player both a Qualifying Offerand a Maximum Qualifying Offer, in which case the Offer Sheet must be
for a Player Contract with a term of more than two (2) Seasons (not
including any Option Year). In order to extend an Offer Sheet, the New
Team must have Room for the player's Player Contract at the time the
Offer Sheet is signed and must continue to have such Room at all times
while the Offer Sheet is outstanding. The ROFR Team, upon receipt of
the Offer Sheet, may exercise its Right of First Refusal, which shall have
the consequences hereinafter set forth below in this Section 5. In order to
match an Offer Sheet, the ROFR Team must have Room for the player's
Player Contract at the time notice of the Team's exercise of its Right of
First Refusal is given and must continue to have Room at all times the
First Refusal Exercise Notice remains in effect.
(c) The following rules shall govern the signing of an Offer Sheet by a
Restricted Free Agent who has one (1) or two (2) Years of Service:
(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
such Offer Sheet may provide for Salary plus Unlikely
Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year totaling more than the
amount of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception
for such Salary Cap Year. Annual increases or decreases in
Salary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by Article
VII, Section 5(c)(1).
(ii) If an Offer Sheet provides for the maximum allowable
amount of Salary for the first two (2) Salary Cap Years
pursuant to Section 5(c)(i) above, then, subject to Section
5(c)(iii) below, the Offer Sheet may provide for Salary for
the third Salary Cap Year of up to the maximum amount
that the player would have been eligible to receive for the
third Salary Cap Year, absent the restriction in the first
sentence of Section 5(c)(i) above and had the player's Salary
for the first two (2) Salary Cap Years been the maximum
amount permitted under Article II, Section 7(a) and Article
VII, Section 5(c)(1). If the Offer Sheet provides for Salary
for the third Salary Cap Year in accordance with the
foregoing sentence, then, subject to Section 5(c)(iii) below,
(A) the player's Salary for the fourth Salary Cap Year may
increase or decrease in relation to the third Salary Cap
Year's Salary by no more than four and one tenth percent(4.1%) of the Salary for the third Salary Cap Year, (B) the
Offer Sheet cannot contain bonuses of any kind, and
(C) the Offer Sheet must provide for one hundred percent
(100%) of the Base Compensation in each Season to be
protected for lack of skill and injury or illness.
(iii) If a Team extends an Offer Sheet in accordance with
Section 5(c)(ii) above, then, for purposes of determining
whether the Team has Room for the Offer Sheet, the
Salary for the first Salary Cap Year covered by the Offer
Sheet shall be deemed to equal the average of the aggregate
Salaries for such Salary Cap Year and each subsequent
Salary Cap Year covered by the Offer Sheet. If the ROFR
Team does not exercise its Right of First Refusal, the
player's Salary for each Salary Cap Year covered by the
Contract with the Team that extended the Offer Sheet shall
be deemed to equal the average of the aggregate Salaries for
each such Salary Cap Year. If the ROFR Team exercises
its Right of First Refusal, the player's Salary for each Salary
Cap Year covered by the Contract with the ROFR Team
shall be the Salary for such Salary Cap Year as set forth in
the Contract.
(d) The Principal Terms of an Offer Sheet are only:
(i) the term of the Contract;
(ii) the fixed and specified Compensation that the New Team
will pay or lend to the Restricted Free Agent as a signing
bonus, Current Base Compensation, and/or Deferred Base
Compensation in specified installments on specified dates;
(iii) Incentive Compensation; provided, however, that the only
elements of such Incentive Compensation that shall be
included in the Principal Terms are the following:
(A) bonuses that qualify as Likely Bonuses based upon the
performance of the Team extending the Offer Sheet and
the ROFR Team; and (B) Generally Recognized League
Honors; and(iv) Any allowable amendments to the terms contained in the
Uniform Player Contract (e.g., Base Compensation
protection, a trade bonus, etc.).
(e) If, within three (3) days from the date it receives an Offer Sheet,
the ROFR Team gives to the Restricted Free Agent a "First Refusal
Exercise Notice" substantially in the form of Exhibit H annexed hereto,
then, subject to Section 5(h) below, such Restricted Free Agent and the
ROFR Team shall be deemed to have entered into a Player Contract
containing all the Principal Terms (but not any terms other than the
Principal Terms) included in the Uniform Player Contract attached to the
Offer Sheet (except that if the Contract contains an Exhibit 6, such
Exhibit 6 shall be deemed deleted). Such Contract may not thereafter be
amended in any manner for a period of one (1) year.
(f) If the ROFR Team does not give the First Refusal Exercise Notice
within the aforementioned three (3) day period, or if during such three (3)
day period the ROFR Team provides written notice to the player that the
Team declines to exercise its Right of First Refusal, then the player and the
New Team shall be deemed to have entered into a Player Contract
containing all of the terms and conditions included in the Uniform Player
Contract attached to the Offer Sheet (including, if the Contract contains an
Exhibit 6, that the player pass a physical examination to be conducted by
the Team as a condition precedent to the validity of the Contract). Such
Contract may not thereafter be amended in any manner for a period of one
(1) year.
(g) After exercising its Right of First Refusal as described in this
Section 5, the ROFR Team may not trade the Restricted Free Agent for
one (1) year, without the player's consent. Even with the player's consent,
for one (1) year, neither the ROFR Team exercising its Right of First
Refusal nor any other Team may trade the player to the Team whose Offer
Sheet was matched.
(h) Any Team may condition its First Refusal Exercise Notice on the
player reporting for and passing, in the sole discretion of the Team, a
physical examination to be conducted by a physician designated by the
Team within two (2) days from its exercise of the Right of First Refusal.
In connection with the physical examination, the player must supply all
information reasonably requested of him, provide complete and truthfulanswers to all questions posed to him, and submit to all examinations and
tests requested of him. In the event the player does not pass the physical
examination: (i) the ROFR Team may withdraw its First Refusal Exercise
Notice within two (2) days following the date upon which such physical
examination is conducted; and (ii) if the First Refusal Exercise Notice is
withdrawn, the player and the New Team shall be deemed to have entered
into a Player Contract in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(f)
above. In the event the player does not submit to the requested physical
examination within two (2) days of the exercise of the Right of First
Refusal then, until such time as the player submits to the requested
physical examination and is notified of the results, the ROFR Team's
conditional First Refusal Exercise Notice shall remain in effect, except that
the ROFR Team may elect at any time to withdraw its First Refusal
Exercise Notice, which shall have the effect of invalidating the Offer Sheet
and causing the Team that issued the Offer Sheet to be prohibited from
signing or acquiring the player for a period of one (1) year from the date
the First Refusal Exercise Notice was withdrawn. If the player does not
submit to the requested physical examination on or before March 1, the
Offer Sheet shall be deemed invalid and the Team that issued the Offer
Sheet shall be prohibited from signing or acquiring the player for a period
of one (1) year from such March 1.
(i) A Team shall not be permitted to exercise its Right of First Refusal
pursuant to an agreement to trade the Player Contract to another Team
pursuant to Article VII, Section 8(e).
(j) There may be only one (1) Offer Sheet signed by a Restricted Free
Agent outstanding at any one time, provided that the Offer Sheet has also
been signed by a Team. An Offer Sheet, both before and after it is given
to the ROFR Team, may be revoked or withdrawn only upon the written
consent of the ROFR Team, the New Team, and the Restricted Free
Agent. In such event, a Restricted Free Agent shall again be free to
negotiate and sign an Offer Sheet with any Team, and any Team shall again
be free to negotiate and sign an Offer Sheet with such Restricted Free
Agent, subject only to the ROFR Team's renewed Right of First Refusal.
(k) A Team that holds the Right of First Refusal with respect to a
Restricted Free Agent may relinquish such Right of First Refusal at any
time except during the period that the player has been given to accept a
Qualifying Offer. If a Team relinquishes its Right of First Refusal withrespect to a Restricted Free Agent, the player shall immediately become an
Unrestricted Free Agent and the Team shall be deemed to have renounced
the player in accordance with Article VII, Section 4(g) hereof. In order to
relinquish its Right of First Refusal with respect to a Restricted Free Agent,
a Team shall provide the NBA with a written statement relinquishing such
Right of First Refusal. The NBA shall provide a copy of such statement to
the Players Association by fax or email within two (2) business days
following its receipt thereof.
(l) An expedited arbitration before the System Arbitrator, whose
decision shall be final and binding upon all parties, shall be the exclusive
method for resolving any disputes concerning this Section 5. If a dispute
arises between the player and either the ROFR Team or the New Team, as
the case may be, relating to the contents of an Offer Sheet, and/or
whether the binding agreement is between the Restricted Free Agent and
the New Team or the Restricted Free Agent and the ROFR Team, such
dispute shall immediately be submitted to the System Arbitrator, who shall
resolve such dispute within five (5) days.
(m) A Restricted Free Agent may not give an Offer Sheet to the ROFR
Team at any time after the March 1 of the Season for which he has been
made a Qualifying Offer.
(n) On the same day as the giving of an Offer Sheet to the ROFR
Team, the ROFR Team shall cause a copy thereof to be given to the NBA,
which shall cause a copy thereof to be promptly given to the Players
Association. On the same day as the giving of a First Refusal Exercise
Notice to the Restricted Free Agent, the ROFR Team shall cause a copy
thereof to be given to the New Team, which shall cause a copy thereof to
be promptly given to the NBA, which shall cause a copy thereof to be
promptly given to the Players Association.
(o) There may be no consideration of any kind given by one Team to
another Team in exchange for a Team's decision to exercise or not to
exercise its Right of First Refusal, or in exchange for a Team's decision to
submit or not to submit an Offer Sheet to a Restricted Free Agent.
(p) Any Offer Sheet, First Refusal Exercise Notice, or other writing
required or permitted to be given under this Article XI, shall be either bypersonal delivery or by pre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail
addressed as follows:
To any NBA Team: addressed to that Team at the principal
address of such Team as then listed on the records of the NBA or
at the Team's principal office, to the attention of the Team's
general manager;
To the NBA: National Basketball Association, Olympic Tower,
645 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10022, Attn: General Counsel;
To the Players Association: National Basketball Players
Association, 310 Lenox Avenue, New York, NY 10027, Attn:
Counsel;
To a Restricted Free Agent: (i) for Qualifying Offers and other
writings relating to Qualifying Offers (e.g., withdrawal of a
Qualifying Offer), to the last known address of the player or his
representative; and (ii) for Offer Sheets and other writings relating
to Offer Sheets (e.g., First Refusal Exercise Notice), to his address
listed on the Offer Sheet, and, if the Restricted Free Agent
designates a representative on the Offer Sheet and lists such
representative's address thereof, a copy shall be sent to such
representative at such address.
(q) An Offer Sheet shall be deemed given only when received by the
ROFR Team. A First Refusal Exercise Notice shall be deemed given
when sent by the ROFR Team. A Qualifying Offer, a Maximum
Qualifying Offer, an amended Qualifying Offer (i.e., pursuant to Section
4(d) above), and a notice of extension of the date by which a Qualifying
Offer can be accepted shall be deemed given when sent by the ROFR
Team. Other writings required or permitted to be given under this Article
XI (e.g., notice relinquishing a Right of First Refusal, an acceptance of a
Qualifying Offer, a withdrawal of a Qualifying Offer, notice that a
Qualifying Offer fails to meet one or more of the criteria for a Qualifying
Offer, etc.) shall be deemed given only when received by the party to
whom it is addressed.
(r) The parties shall use reasonable efforts to develop an electronic
notice process (e.g., a jointly-administered website) to facilitate the deliveryof Offer Sheets, First Refusal Exercise Notices, Qualifying Offers and
other writings required or permitted to be given under this Article XI in
time for the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year. Until such time as both the NBA
and the Players Association agree in writing that the electronic notice
process is operational, the notice provisions contained in this Article XI
shall remain in full force and effect. Once the electronic notice process
referred to above is operational, such process will be used for the delivery
of Offer Sheets, First Refusal Exercise Notices, Qualifying Offers and
other writings required or permitted to be given under this Article XI and
validly-posted notices will be deemed given to the other party immediately
upon posting.
