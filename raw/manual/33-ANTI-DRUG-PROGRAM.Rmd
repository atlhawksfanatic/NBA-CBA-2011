this Section 3.
(f) Other than as reasonably required by the Reasonable Cause
Testing procedure set forth in Section 5 below, neither the NBA nor the

NBA and the Players Association). The NBA and the Medical Director
(after consultation with the Players Association) are authorized to retain
such consultants and support services as are necessary and appropriate to
administer and conduct such testing.
(b) All tests conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII shall be
analyzed by laboratories selected by the NBA and the Players Association,
approved by the Medical Director, and certified by the World Anti-DopingAgency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA), or the International Olympic Committee.
(c) Any test conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII will be
considered "positive" for a Prohibited Substance under the following
circumstances:
(i) If the test is for a Prohibited Substance other than a SPED
or Diuretic and it is confirmed by laboratory analysis at the
levels established at the time of the test by SAMHSA;
provided, however, if there is no confirmatory level
established by SAMHSA for one or more of such
Prohibited Substances at the time of the test, then the level
for such Prohibited Substance shall be: amphetamines and
their analogs—500 ng/ml; cocaine metabolites—150
ng/ml; LSD—200 pg/ml; marijuana metabolites—15
ng/ml; MDMA—500 ng/ml; opiate metabolites—2,000

analysis at the levels set forth in Exhibit I-4.
(iii) If a player refuses to submit to a test or cooperate fully
with the testing process, without a reasonable explanation
satisfactory to the Medical Director; provided, however,
that the NBA will use its best efforts (A) to have the drug
testing collectors immediately notify the NBA when any
player refuses to submit to a test or cooperate fully with the
testing process, and (B) to provide such information to the
Players Association as soon as possible thereafter; and
provided, further, that (C) following any player's refusal to
submit to a test or failure to cooperate fully with the testing
process, the drug testing collector shall wait ninety (90)
minutes at the collection site, and (D) if the player submits
to the test and cooperates fully with the testing process
within such additional time, then his earlier refusal or
failure to cooperate shall be excused and the test shall not
be deemed positive under this Section 4(c).(iv) If the player fails to submit to a scheduled test, without a
reasonable explanation satisfactory to the Medical Director.
(v) If the player attempts to substitute, dilute, or adulterate a
specimen sample or in any other manner alter a test result
(other than by testing positive for a Diuretic).
(vi) If the test is positive for a Diuretic, and it is confirmed by
laboratory analysis at any detectable level.
(d) The NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association of any
positive test conducted by the NBA, and shall thereafter notify the player.
The Medical Director shall promptly notify the player of any positive test
conducted by the Medical Director; provided, however, that if the positive
test will result in a penalty to be imposed on the player, the Medical
Director shall notify the NBA and the Players Association of the positive
test result and the NBA shall thereafter notify the player of such result and
such penalty.
(e) Any player who is notified of a positive test pursuant to Section
4(d) above may, within five (5) business days of such notification, inform
the NBA and the Players Association that he requests testing of the split or
"B" sample of his specimen. The test of the "B" sample will be performed
at a laboratory other than the laboratory that performed the test on the
original or "A" sample. Any such test shall be subject to the provisions of
this Section 4 and shall be sent to the laboratory for testing within ten (10)
business days of the player's request.
(f) Any positive test pursuant to Sections 4(c)(i), (ii), or (vi) above shall
be reviewed by the Medical Director. If the Medical Director determines,
in his professional judgment, that there is a valid alternative medical
explanation for such positive test result, then the test shall be deemed
negative.
(g) If the test result for any player is reported by the laboratory as
"invalid" or "endogenous steroids abnormally low," the NBA shall
promptly notify the Players Association, and shall thereafter notify the
player. In the event of such a test result, the player shall be required to
submit to another test on a date determined by the NBA that is not more
than thirty (30) days after the date of the original test (the "Re-Test"). Ifthe Re-Test results in (i) a positive test for a Drug of Abuse or a positive
test under Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above, the player shall be immediately
be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or its
Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below; (ii) a
positive test for marijuana, the player shall suffer the applicable
consequences set forth in Section 8 below; or (iii) a positive test for a
SPED or Diuretic, the player shall suffer the applicable consequences set
forth in Section 9 below. The original test will not be counted towards the
number of tests to be administered to that player for that Season under
Section 6 (Random Testing) below.
Section 5. Reasonable Cause Testing or Hearing.
(a) In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association has
information that gives it reasonable cause to believe that a player is
engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance,
including information that a First-Year Player may have been engaged in
such conduct during the period beginning three (3) months prior to his
entry into the NBA, such party shall request a conference with the other
party and the Independent Expert, which shall be held within twenty-four
(24) hours or as soon thereafter as the Expert is available. Upon hearing
the information presented, the Independent Expert shall immediately
decide whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the player in
question has been engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a
Prohibited Substance. If the Independent Expert decides that such
reasonable cause exists, the Expert shall thereupon issue an Authorization
for Testing with respect to such player.
(b) In evaluating the information presented to him, the Independent
Expert shall use his independent judgment based upon his experience in
substance abuse detection and enforcement. The parties acknowledge that
the type of information to be presented to the Independent Expert is likely
to consist of reports of conversations with third parties of the type
generally considered by law enforcement authorities to be reliable sources,
and that such sources might not otherwise come forward if their identities
were to become known. Accordingly, neither the NBA nor the Players
Association shall be required to divulge to each other or to the
Independent Expert the names (or other identifying characteristics) of
their sources of information regarding the use, possession, or distribution
of a Prohibited Substance, and the absence of such identification ofsources, standing alone, shall not constitute a basis for the Expert to refuse
to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to a player. In
conferences with the Independent Expert, the player involved shall not be
identified by name until such time as the Expert has determined to issue an
Authorization for Testing with respect to such player in the form set forth
in Exhibit I-1 to this Agreement.
(c) Immediately upon the Independent Expert's issuance of an
Authorization for Testing with respect to a particular player, the NBA shall
arrange for such player to undergo testing for Drugs of Abuse (if the
Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the use,
possession, or distribution of a Drug of Abuse), for marijuana (if the
authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player's
use, possession, or distribution of marijuana), or for SPEDs (if the
Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player's
use, possession, or distribution of a SPED) no more than four (4) times
during the six-week period commencing with the issuance of the
Authorization for Testing. Such testing may be administered at any time,
in the discretion of the NBA, without prior notice to the player.
(d) In the event that the player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse
pursuant to this Section 5, or tests positive pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii), (iv)
or (v) above in connection with testing conducted pursuant to this Section
5, he shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association
with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11(a) below. If the player tests positive for marijuana or a SPED
pursuant to this Section 5, he shall enter the Program and suffer the
applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may
be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall suffer the applicable
consequences of a positive test for the Prohibited Substance for which the
Authorization for Testing was issued.
(e) In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association
determines that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that, within the
previous year, a player has engaged in the use, possession, or distribution
of a Prohibited Substance, or has received treatment for use of a
Prohibited Substance other than in accordance with the terms of this
Article XXXIII, it may, in lieu of requesting the testing procedure set forth
in Section 5(a)-(d) above, request a hearing on the matter before the
Grievance Arbitrator. If the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that, withinthe previous year, the Player has used, possessed, or distributed a
Prohibited Substance, or has received treatment other than in accordance
with the terms of this Article XXXIII, the player shall immediately be
dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its
Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below,
notwithstanding the fact that the player has not undergone the testing
procedure set forth in this Section 5; provided, however, that if the
Grievance Arbitrator concludes that the player has used or possessed
marijuana or a SPED, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable
consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may be.
Section 6. Random Testing.
(a) In addition to the testing procedures set forth in Section 5 above, a
player shall be required to undergo testing for Prohibited Substances at any
time, without prior notice to the player, no more than four (4) times each
Season and no more than two (2) times during each Off-Season. During
each Season, the NBA will conduct no more than 1,525 total tests. During
the Off-Season, the NBA will conduct no more than 600 total tests. The
scheduling of testing and collection of urine samples will be conducted
according to a random player selection procedure by a third-party
organization, and neither the NBA, the Players Association, any Team or
any player will have any involvement in selecting the players to be tested or
will receive prior notice of the testing schedule; provided, however, that it
shall not be a violation of the foregoing for the third-party organization (or
a specimen collector for the same) to provide advance notice of a
scheduled collection to an NBA Team Security Representative, so long as
such notice does not identify the player(s) who will be tested and seeks
merely to facilitate access of the collector to the testing location. Urine
samples collected during the Season will be tested for all Prohibited
Substances; urine samples collected during the Off-Season will be tested
for SPEDs and Diuretics only and may not under any circumstances be
tested with respect to any other Prohibited Substances.
(b) (i) In the event that a First-Year Player tests positive for a
Drug of Abuse pursuant to this Section 6, he shall
immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any
association with the NBA or its Teams for a period of one
(1) year, his Player Contract shall be rendered null and void
and of no further force or effect (subject to the provisionsof paragraph 8 of the Uniform Player Contract), and he
shall enter Stage 1 of the Drugs of Abuse Program. Such
dismissal and disqualification shall be mandatory and may
not be rescinded or reduced by the player's Team or the
NBA.
(ii) During any period while a First-Year Player is dismissed
and disqualified from the NBA under Section 6(b)(i) above,
and so long as such player is in compliance with his in-
patient or aftercare obligations under the Program (as
determined by the Medical Director), he shall receive from
his Team a reasonable and necessary living expense stipend
to be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association
which (A) shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of
the Salary that the player would otherwise have been
entitled to earn for the period of his dismissal and
disqualification and (B) shall not be payable for more than
one (1) year from the date of such dismissal and
disqualification.
(iii) Any First-Year Player who tests positive for marijuana or a
SPED pursuant to this Section 6, shall suffer the applicable
consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case
may be. Any First-Year Player who tests positive for a
Diuretic pursuant to this Section 6, shall suffer the
applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 below.
(c) In the event that a Veteran Player tests positive for a Drug of
Abuse pursuant to this Section 6, he shall immediately be dismissed and
disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in
accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below. If the player tests
positive for marijuana or a SPED pursuant to this Section 6, he shall enter
the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8
or 9 below, as the case may be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic
pursuant to this Section 6, he shall enter the SPED Program and suffer the
applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 below.
(d) In the event that any player tests "positive" pursuant to Section
4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above in connection with testing conducted pursuant to
this Section 6, that positive test result shall be considered a positive testresult for a Drug of Abuse, and the player shall immediately be dismissed
and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in
accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below.
Section 7. Drugs of Abuse Program.
(a) Voluntary Entry.
(i) A player may enter the Drugs of Abuse Program
voluntarily at any time by Coming Forward Voluntarily for
a problem involving the use of a Drug of Abuse; provided,
however, that a player may not Come Forward Voluntarily

not preclude the imposition of any penalty called for by
this Article XXXIII as a result of conduct by the player
that occurs after he has Come Forward Voluntarily.
(b) Treatment.
(i) A player who enters the SPED Program shall be required

or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions
of Section 11(a) below.
(b) Marijuana.
(i) Any player who, after entering the Marijuana Program, fails
to comply (without a reasonable excuse) with his treatment
program as prescribed and determined by the Medical
Director, shall be fined \$5,000 for each day that he fails to

total amount of such fines shall not exceed the player's
total Compensation.
(ii) Notwithstanding Section 10(b)(i) above, any player who,
after entering the Marijuana Program, fails to comply with
his treatment program as prescribed and determined by the

Program.
(c) SPEDs.
(i) Any player who, after entering the SPED Program, fails to
comply (without a reasonable excuse) with his treatment
program as prescribed and determined by the Medical
Director, shall be fined \$5,000 per day for each day that he

which his team is scheduled to travel, any two (2) Team practices, or a
combination of any one (1) practice and any one (1) Team flight, shall
immediately submit to a urine test to be conducted by the NBA. If any
test conducted pursuant to this Section 10(d) is positive: (x) for a Drug of
Abuse or pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii), (iv) or (v) above (for a player in the
Drugs of Abuse Program), then the player shall suffer the applicable
consequence set forth in Section 10(a)(ii) above; (y) for marijuana or

Section 11. Dismissal and Disqualification.
(a) A player who, under the terms of this Agreement, is "dismissed
and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in
accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a)" shall, without exception,
immediately be so dismissed and disqualified for a period of not less than
two (2) years, and such player's Player Contract shall be rendered null and
void and of no further force or effect (subject to the provisions of
paragraph 8 of the Uniform Player Contract). Such dismissal anddisqualification shall be mandatory and may not be rescinded or reduced
by the player's Team or the NBA.
(b) In addition to any other provision of this Agreement requiring that
a player be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA
or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a)
above, a player will also be dismissed and disqualified under Section 11(a)
above if he is convicted of (including a plea of guilty, no contest, or nolo
contendere to) a crime involving the use, possession or distribution of a
Prohibited Substance other than marijuana or a felony involving the
distribution of marijuana.
Section 12. Reinstatement.
(a) After a period of at least two (2) years from the time of a player's
dismissal and disqualification under Section 11(a) above, and after a period
of at least one (1) year from the date of a First-Year Player's dismissal and
disqualification under Section 6(b) above, such player may apply for
reinstatement as a player in the NBA. However, such player shall have no
right to reinstatement under any circumstance and the reinstatement shall
be granted only with the prior approval of both the NBA and the Players
Association, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The approval of
the NBA and the Players Association shall rest in their absolute and sole
discretion, and their decision shall be final, binding, and unappealable.
Among the factors that may be considered by the NBA and the Players
Association in determining whether to grant reinstatement are (without
limitation): the circumstances surrounding the player's dismissal and
disqualification; whether the player has satisfactorily completed a treatment
and rehabilitation program; the player's conduct since his dismissal,
including the extent to which the player has since comported himself as a
suitable role model for youth; and whether the player is judged to possess
the requisite qualities of good character and morality.
(b) For a First-Year Player, the NBA and the Players Association will
consider an application for reinstatement only if the player has, in the
opinion of the Medical Director, successfully completed any in-patient
treatment and/or aftercare prescribed by the Medical Director. For a
Veteran Player, the NBA and the Players Association will consider any
application for reinstatement only if the player can demonstrate, by proof
of random urine testing acceptable to the Medical Director (conducted onat least a weekly basis), that he has not tested positive (i) for a Prohibited
Substance within the twelve (12) months prior to the submission of his
application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is
being reviewed, and (ii) if the Medical Director deems it necessary in his or
her professional judgment, for alcohol for the six (6) months prior to the
submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period
while his application is being reviewed.
(c) The granting of an application for reinstatement may be
conditioned upon random testing of the player or such other terms as may
be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association, whether or not
such terms are contemplated by the terms of this Article XXXIII.
(d) Any player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 and
is subsequently dismissed and disqualified from any association with the
NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section
11(a) above shall therefore be ineligible for reinstatement pursuant to this
Section 12.
(e) In the event that the application for reinstatement of a First-Year
Player dismissed and disqualified pursuant to Section 6(b) above is
approved, such player, by reason of his Player Contract having been
rendered null and void pursuant to Section 6(b) above, shall be deemed
not to have completed his Player Contract by rendering the playing
services called for thereunder. Accordingly, such player shall not be a Free
Agent and shall not be entitled to negotiate or sign a Player Contract with
any NBA Team, except as specifically provided in this Section 12.
(f) (i) A First-Year Player who has been reinstated pursuant to
this Section 12 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement,
notify the Team to which he was under contract at the time
of his dismissal and disqualification (the "previous Team").
Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Section
12(f)(ii) below, the previous Team shall then have thirty
(30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with a
stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the
event that the Tender is made during a Season, of at least
the remainder of that Season) and calling for at least the
Minimum Player Salary then applicable to that player but
not more than the Salary provided for in Section 12(f)(ii)below. If the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall,
for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be
the only NBA Team with which the player may negotiate
and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a
Player Contract with the previous Team within the year
following such Tender, the player shall thereupon be
deemed a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First
Refusal. If the previous Team fails to make a Tender, the
player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.
(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12(f)(i)
above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a
Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves
the notice required by Section 12(f)(i), he is under contract
to a professional basketball team not in the NBA, or (B)
the player signs a contract with a professional basketball
team not in the NBA at any point after the date on which
the player serves the notice required by Section 12(f)(i) and
before the date on which the previous Team makes a
Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled
pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain
tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team
that he is immediately available to sign and begin rendering
playing services under a Player Contract with such Team,
provided that such notice will not be effective until the
player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to
sign with and begin rendering playing services for such
team.
(iii) A First-Year Player who is reinstated pursuant to this
Section 12 may enter into a Player Contract with his
previous Team that provides for a Salary and Unlikely
Bonuses for the first Season of up to the Player's Salary
and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year
in which he was dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a
pro rata basis if the first Season of the new Contract is a
partial Season), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or
above the Salary Cap or such Player Contract causes the
Team to have a Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the
player and the previous Team enter into such PlayerContract and such Contract covers more than one Season,
increases and decreases in Salary for Seasons following the
first Season shall be governed by Article VII, Section
5(c)(1); provided, however, that if the player who is
reinstated was dismissed and disqualified during the term
of his Rookie Scale Contract, then (A) the number of
Seasons in the player's new Contract may not exceed two
(2) Seasons plus two (2) Option Years in favor of the
Team, and the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for in
any Season of the player's new Contract, including any
Option Year, may not exceed the Salary and Unlikely
Bonuses called for during the corresponding Season of his
Rookie Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract
contains terms identical to those contained in the
remaining Seasons of the Player's Rookie Scale Contract at
the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Team
exercises all Option Year(s) available under the new
Contract, then the player's Team shall retain the same
rights with respect to such new Contract as it would have
retained under Article XI following the completion of the
player's Rookie Scale Contract.
(g) (i) A Veteran Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this
Section 12 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement,
notify the Team to which he was under contract at the time
of his dismissal and disqualification (the "previous Team").
Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Section
12(g)(ii) below, the previous Team shall then have thirty
(30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with a
stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the
event the Tender is made during a Season, of at least the
rest of that Season) and calling for a Salary in the first
Season covered by the Tender at least equal to the lesser of
(A) the player's Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which he
was dismissed and disqualified, or (B) the Estimated
Average Player Salary during the then-current Season, in
either case reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season
covered by the Tender is a partial Season, but not greater
than the Salary provided in Section 12(g)(iii) below. If the
previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a periodof one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only
NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and sign a
Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player
Contract with the previous Team within the year following
such Tender, then the player shall thereupon be deemed a
Restricted or an Unrestricted Free Agent, in accordance
with the provisions of Article XI. If the previous Team
fails to make a Required Tender, the player shall become an
Unrestricted Free Agent.
(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
12(g)(i) above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to
make a Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player
serves the notice required by Section 12(g)(i), he is under
contract to a professional basketball team not in the NBA,
or (B) the player signs a contract with a professional
basketball team not in the NBA at any point after the date
on which he serves the notice required by Section 12(g)(i)
and before the date on which the previous Team makes a
Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled
pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain
tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team
that he is available to sign a Player Contract with and begin
rendering playing services for such Team immediately,
provided that such notice will not be effective until the
player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to
sign with and begin rendering playing services for such
Team.
(iii) A Veteran Player who is reinstated pursuant to this Section
12 may enter into a Player Contract with his previous Team
that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first
Season of up to the player's Salary and Unlikely Bonuses,
respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he was
dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis if
the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season),
even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary
Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a
Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the
previous Team enter into such Player Contract and suchContract covers more than one (1) Season, increases and
decreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season
shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(c)(i); provided,
however, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed
and disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale
Contract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the Player's
new Contract may not exceed the number of Seasons
(including the Option Year in favor of the Team) that
remained under the player's Rookie Scale Contract at the
time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Salary
called for in any Season of the Player's new Contract
(including any Option Year), may not exceed the Salary
called for during the corresponding Season of his Rookie
Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract contains terms
identical to those contained in the remaining Seasons of the
player's Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed
and disqualified, and the player's Team ultimately exercises
the Option Year available under the new Contract, then
such Team shall retain the same rights with respect to such
new Contract as it would have retained under Article XI
following the completion of the player's Rookie Scale
Contract.
Section 13. Exclusivity of the Program.
(a) Except as expressly provided in this Article XXXIII, there shall be
no other screening or testing for Prohibited Substances conducted by the
NBA or any Team, and no player may undergo such screening or testing;
provided, however, that, in a medical emergency, team physicians may test
players solely for diagnostic purposes in order to provide satisfactory
medical care. The results of any diagnostic drug testing conducted
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be used for any other purpose
by the player's Team or the NBA. If any Team is found to have tested a
player in violation of this Section 13, the NBA will impose a substantial
fine not to exceed \$750,000 upon such Team pursuant to the NBA's
Constitution and By-Laws.
(b) The penalties set forth in this Article XXXIII shall be the exclusive
penalties to be imposed upon a player for the use, possession or
distribution of a Prohibited Substance.(c) No Uniform Player Contract entered into after the date hereof
shall include any term or provision that modifies, contradicts, changes, or
is inconsistent with paragraph 8 of such Contract (including any condition
or limitation on salary protection, as precluded by Article II, Section 4(l))
or provides for the testing of a player for illegal substances. Any term or
provision of a currently effective Uniform Player Contract that is
inconsistent with paragraph 8 of such Contract shall be deemed null and
void only to the extent of the inconsistency.
Section 14. HGH Blood Testing.
(a) The NBA and the Players Association shall, no later than March
15, 2012, appoint an HGH Testing Panel (the "HGH Panel"), which shall
be comprised of three (3) individuals who shall be experts in the field of
testing for performance-enhancing substances. If the NBA and the
Players Association are unable to agree on the members of the HGH Panel
by the date specified, each shall appoint one (1) expert to the HGH Panel
by April 1, 2012, and these two (2) experts shall, by April 15, 2012, appoint
the third expert member of the HGH Panel.
(b) The purpose of the HGH Panel is to determine whether, in its
judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably
detect exogenous HGH in NBA players and, if so, to determine the
laboratory testing protocols and specimen collection procedures to be
implemented in connection with such test. The Panel may use such
methods and collect such information as, in its judgment, are necessary
and appropriate to make these determinations, and the NBA, the Players
Association, NBA Teams, and NBA players shall cooperate fully in this
process -- including, with respect to players, by permitting any anonymous
baseline testing (by blood testing or otherwise) that the HGH Panel may
determine, in its judgment, is necessary and appropriate. (Any such testing
shall not result in any penalty for any player.)
(c) By July 1, 2012, the HGH Panel shall issue a written report to the
NBA and the Players Association setting forth its determination as to
whether, in its judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine
test to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players. If the Panel
determines that such test does not exist, it shall issue a written report to
the parties on each succeeding July 1, setting forth its determination as to
whether, in its judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urinetest to reliably detect exogenous HGH in NBA players. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, either party may -- no more than once each year -- request
in writing (with a copy to the other side) that the HGH Panel consider
developments in the science relating to HGH testing and issue, within
three (3) months of such request, a determination as to whether, in its
judgment, there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably
detect exogenous HGH in NBA players.
(d) If, pursuant to the foregoing, the HGH Panel determines that
there exists a scientifically valid blood or urine test to reliably detect
exogenous HGH in NBA players and provides written notice to the NBA
and the Players Association of the same (which shall include a description
of the laboratory testing protocols and specimen collection procedures to
be implemented in connection with such testing), the NBA may
commence HGH Blood Testing within sixty (60) days thereafter, after
notice is provided to NBA players. Such testing may take place under
Section 5 (Reasonable Cause Testing), Section 6 (Random Testing) and
Section 9 (Steroids, Performance-Enhancing Drugs and Masking Agents)
above, and Section 15 (Additional Bases for Testing) below; provided,
however, that random HGH Blood Testing pursuant to Section 6 above
will occur no more than two (2) times during each Season and no more
than one (1) time during each Off-Season. (For clarity, the number of
random blood tests for Human Growth Hormone shall be in addition to
the number of random urine tests for other Prohibited Substances called
for in Section 6 above.) Random HGH blood tests shall occur at the same
time that players undergo random urine tests for other SPEDs.
Section 15. Additional Bases for Testing.
(a) Any player who seeks treatment outside the Program for a
problem involving a Prohibited Substance shall, as directed by the NBA
(after notice to the Players Association), submit himself to an evaluation by
the Medical Director and provide (or cause to be provided) to the Medical
Director such medical and treatment records as the Medical Director may
request. The Medical Director may, in his or her professional judgment,
also require such a player, without prior notice, to submit to testing for
Prohibited Substances, provided that the frequency of such testing shall
not exceed three (3) times per week and the duration of such testing shall
not exceed one (1) year from the date of the player's initial evaluation by
the Medical Director.(b) Any player who is subject to in-patient or aftercare treatment in the
Program and is formally charged with "driving while intoxicated," "driving
under the influence of alcohol," or any other crime or offense involving
suspected alcohol or illegal substance use shall, provided that the NBA has
advised the Players Association, be required to submit to a urine test, to be
