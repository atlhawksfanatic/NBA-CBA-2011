any other entity which is controlled, or in which at least fifty
percent (50%) of the issued and outstanding ownership interests
are owned, by the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, and/or a
group of NBA Teams (hereinafter, "League-related entity") (but
excluding the amount of such League-related entity's revenues
equal to the portion of its total revenues that is proportionate to
the share of the entity's profits to which ownership interests not
owned by the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures and/or a group
of NBA Teams are entitled), all NBA Teams other than
Expansion Teams during their first two (2) Salary Cap Years (but
including the Expansion Teams' shares of national television,

accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below), from all sources,
whether known or unknown, whether now in existence or created
in the future, to the extent derived from, relating to, or arising
directly or indirectly out of, the performance of Players in NBA

not be limited to, any type of revenue included in BRI for the
1995-96 and 1996-97 Salary Cap Years (without regard to whether
such type of revenue is received on a lump-sum, non-recurring or
extraordinary basis, but subject to any specific rules set forth in
this Article VII relating to the recognition or amortization of such
amounts); and (y) "Player" means a person: who is under a Player
Contract to an NBA Team; who completed the playing services
called for under a Player Contract with an NBA Team at the
conclusion of the prior Season; or who was under a Player
Contract with an NBA Team during (but not at the conclusion of)
the prior Season, but only with respect to the period for which he
was under such Contract. Subject to the foregoing, BRI shall
include, but not be limited to, the following revenues:
(i) Regular Season gate receipts, net of applicable taxes,
surcharges, imposts, and other charges (including, without
limitation, charges related to arena financings) imposed by
governmental or quasi-governmental agencies other than
income taxes (collectively, "Taxes"), including, without
limitation, gate receipts received or to be received by a
Related Party in accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below,
including: (A) the value (determined on the basis of the
price of the ticket) of all tickets traded by a Team for goods
or services; and (B) the value (determined on the basis of
the League-wide average ticket price for non-Season tickets)
of all tickets for Regular Season games provided by a Team
on a complimentary basis, without monetary or other
compensation to a Team; provided, however, that (x) the
value of the "Excluded Complimentary Tickets" with
respect to all Regular Season games in a Season shall be
excluded from BRI, and (y) in addition, tickets provided as
part of sponsorships and other transactions, where the
proceeds from such transactions have been included in BRI,
shall not be included in determining the number of
complimentary tickets in any Season. For purposes of the
foregoing, "Excluded Complimentary Tickets" shall mean
1.6 million tickets for the 2011-12 Season, increasing by
50,000 tickets for each Season during the term of this
Agreement;(ii) all proceeds of any kind, net of reasonable and customary
expenses related thereto, from the broadcast or exhibition

NBA-related off-season games involving Players, highlights
or portions of such games, and non-game NBA
programming, on any and all forms of radio, television,
telephone, internet, and any other communications media,
forms of reproduction and other technologies, whether
presently existing or not, anywhere in the world, whether
live or on any form of delay, including, without limitation,
network, local, cable, direct broadcast satellite and any form
of pay television, and all other means of distribution and
exploitation, whether presently existing or not and whether
now known or hereafter developed, including, without
limitation, such proceeds received or to be received by a
Related Party (in accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below),
but not including the value of any broadcast, cablecast or
telecast time provided as part of any such transaction that is
used solely: (A) to promote or advertise the NBA, its
Teams, League-related entities that generate BRI, Players,
the NBA Development League (the "NBADL") (except to
the extent the value of such time for the NBADL exceeds
\$5 million), or the sport of basketball (but not the value of
time used to promote or advertise the Women's National
Basketball Association (the "WNBA") which shall be
included in BRI); (B) to promote or advertise products,
programming, merchandise, services or events that produce

Section 1(a)(7)(i) below);
(iv) all playoff gate receipts of any kind, net of Taxes, arena
rentals to the extent reasonable and customary, and all other
reasonable and customary expenses, except the Player

received or to be received by a Related Party (in accordance
with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below);
(v) all proceeds of any kind, net of reasonable and customary
expenses (including Taxes) related thereto, subject to the
provisions of Section 1(a)(6) below, from in-arena sales of

identified stores located within such radius of the Team's
home arena as is permitted by the NBA, NBA game parking

in NBA basketball games or NBA-related activities,
including, without limitation, such proceeds received or to
be received by a Related Party (in accordance with Section
1(a)(7)(i) below);
(vi) forty percent (40%) of the gross proceeds, net of Taxes,
from the sale of fixed arena signage within or outside of the

its Regular Season home games, including, without
limitation, such proceeds received or to be received by a
Related Party (in accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below);
(vii) forty percent (40%) of the gross proceeds of any kind, net

the entity, including, without limitation, proceeds received
or to be received by a Related Party (in accordance withSection 1(a)(7)(i) below), that sold, leased, or licensed such
luxury suites; provided, however, that, other than the
additional amounts paid by luxury suite holders to the Team
for tickets pursuant to arrangements in which admission to
games is not part of the agreement to buy, lease or license
the luxury suite, thereby requiring the luxury suiteholder to
make a separate payment for such admission, if any, this
amount shall be the only amount included in BRI for the
sale, lease or licensing of luxury suites and that, to the extent
that the sale, lease or licensing of the luxury suite grants
rights to the luxury suite for a period of more than one (1)
year, for purposes of calculating the amount includable in
BRI for any Salary Cap Year, the proceeds shall be
determined on the basis of the annual fee or charge
provided for in any such transaction and, if payments are
made in addition to or in the absence of such an annual fee
or charge, the value of such payments shall be amortized
over the period of the sale, lease or license, unless such
period exceeds twenty (20) years, in which event an
amortization period of twenty (20) years shall be used;
(viii) fifty percent (50%) of the gross proceeds, net of Taxes,
from arena naming rights agreements with respect to arenas

Regular Season home games, including, without limitation,
such proceeds received or to be received by a Related Party
(in accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below);
(ix) except as provided in Section 1(a)(2) below, proceeds

related thereto, subject to the provisions of Section 1(a)(6)
below, from the following: (A) international television;

luxury suites, which are governed by Section 1(a)(1)(vii)
above), net of Taxes, attributable to NBA-related events
amortized over the period of the license (including, without
limitation, such proceeds received or to be received by a
Related Party (in accordance with Section 1(a)(7)(i) below),

an amortization period of twenty (20) years shall be used;
(xi) fifty percent (50%) of the gross proceeds, net of Taxes,
from the sale of naming rights with respect to practice
facilities used by NBA Teams, including, without limitation,
such proceeds received or to be received by a Related Party

(xii) if the right to receive revenues included in BRI is sold or
transferred to an entity other than an entity referred to in
Section 1(a)(1) above (such that those revenues would not
be included in BRI pursuant to that subsection), then BRI
shall be deemed to include the amount of revenues that
would have been received by the seller or transferor and
would have been included in BRI in such Salary Cap Year
(subject to any applicable allocations provided for above),
absent such sale or transfer, provided that a pledge,
hypothecation, collateral assignment or other similar
transaction involving such revenues, shall not be considered
a sale or transfer within the meaning of this Section
1(a)(1)(xii).
(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section (a)(1)
above, it is understood that the following is a non-exclusive list of
examples of revenues that are or may be received by the NBA,
Properties, Media Ventures, other League-related entities, NBA
Teams and Related Parties (the foregoing persons or entities,
beginning with "NBA," collectively referred to in this
Section 1(a)(2) only as "NBA-related entities") that are not
derived from, and do not relate to or arise out of, the
performance of Players in NBA basketball games or in NBA-
related activities or are otherwise expressly excluded from the
definition of BRI:(i) proceeds from the assignment of Player Contracts;
(ii) proceeds (A) from the sale, transfer or other disposition of
any of the assets or property (excluding ordinary course
sales of inventory and the revenues (if any) deemed to be
included in BRI pursuant to Section 1(a)(1)(xii) above) of, or
ownership interests in, any NBA-related entity, or (B) from
loans or other financing transactions;

(vii) revenue sharing (by means of revenue transfers or

(viii) interest income;
(ix) insurance recoveries, except where, and only to the extent
that, such recoveries are in respect of lost revenues that
would have otherwise been included in BRI, in which event
such recoveries shall be included in BRI in the Salary Cap
Year in which they are received;
(x) proceeds from the sale or rental of real estate;
(xi) any thing of value received in connection with the design or
construction of a new or renovated arena or other team
facility including, but not limited to, receipt of title to or a
leasehold interest in real property or improvements,
reimbursement of project-related expenses, benefits from
project-related infrastructure improvements, or tax
abatements, unless (and only to the extent that) such value is
being provided to the Team or a Related Party in lieu ofpayments that the Team or Related Party would have
otherwise received pursuant to an arena lease or other
instrument concerning a Team's use of an arena ("lease")
and would have constituted BRI if paid to the Team or a
Related Party; provided, however, that the determination of
the amount, if any, to be included in BRI with respect to the
value of any of the foregoing shall be made either (A) in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1(a)(4) below or
(B) based upon direct evidence that the Team or Related
Party, after proposing that it would receive certain revenues
constituting arena-generated BRI, subsequently agreed
specifically to forego such revenues in direct exchange for a
thing of value (as described above in this Section 1(a)(2)(xi))
with the consequence that the arena-generated BRI
revenues received or to be received by the Team or Related
Party were or would be (in the opinion of the Accountants)
less than the fair market value of arena-generated BRI
revenues received or to be received by other NBA Teams in
similar transactions, or (C) based upon direct evidence that
the parties to the transaction had agreed that certain
revenues constituting arena-generated BRI would be paid to
the Team or Related Party and that such revenues were
subsequently foregone by the Team or the Related Party in
direct exchange for a thing of value (as described above in
this Section 1(a)(2)(xi)); and provided further that, when a
determination is made pursuant to clause (B) or clause (C)
of this Section 1(a)(2)(xi), the amount(s), if any, to be
included in BRI shall be allocated (with an appropriate
interest adjustment to reflect the time value of money where
the thing of value received by the Team or Related Party is
in the form of cash or a cash equivalent, such as a check or
wire transfer) over the Salary Cap Years in which the arena-
generated BRI revenues foregone would have been received
by the Team or Related Party (up to a maximum of
twenty (20) Salary Cap Years) and not on a lump-sum basis;
(xii) any thing of value that induces or is intended to induce a
Team either to relocate to or remain in a particular
geographic location, unless (and only to the extent that)
such value is being provided to the Team or a Related Partyin lieu of payments that the Team or Related Party would
have otherwise received pursuant to an arena lease and that
would have constituted BRI had they been paid to the Team
or a Related Party; provided, however, that the
determination of the amount, if any, to be included in BRI
shall be made either (A) in accordance with the provisions
of Section 1(a)(4) below or (B) based upon direct evidence
that the parties to the transaction had agreed that certain
revenues constituting arena-generated BRI would be
foregone by the Team or Related Party, in direct exchange
for a thing of value as described above in this
Section 1(a)(2)(xii), and provided, further that, when a
determination is made pursuant to clause (B) of this
Section 1(a)(2)(xii), the amount(s), if any, to be included in
BRI shall be allocated (with an appropriate interest
adjustment to reflect the time value of money where the
thing of value received by the Team or Related Party is in
the form of cash or a cash equivalent, such as a check or
wire transfer) over the Salary Cap Years in which the arena-
generated BRI revenues foregone would have been received
by the Team or Related Party (up to a maximum of
fifteen (15) Salary Cap Years) and not on a lump-sum basis;
(xiii) payments made to Teams or to the NBA pursuant to the
provisions of Article VII, Section 12 (Escrow and Tax
Arrangement) below;
(xiv) distributions, dividends or royalties paid by any NBA-related
entity to owners, shareholders, members or partners;
(xv) any category or source of revenue or proceeds that was
expressly identified in any BRI Report (as defined in Section
10(b) below) or in any document or written communication
(including debriefing memos) authored by the Accountants
and provided to the Players Association and the NBA (but
excluding any underlying work papers) in connection with
the Audit Reports for any of the 1995-96 through 2010-11
Salary Cap Years that was not included in BRI for such
Salary Cap Years, unless such category or source was
included on the "open issues" list prepared by the
Accountants in connection with any of the Audit Reportsfor the 2005-06 through 2010-11 Salary Cap Years, in which
case such category or source shall be included in or excluded
from BRI, as the case may be, in accordance with the other
terms of this Article;
(xvi) proceeds received by (A) Properties (and its related entities)
pursuant to the Group License Agreement (including, but
not limited to, proceeds received pursuant to the license of
"fantasy games," which proceeds are to be included in the
computation of Player Merchandise Revenues in accordance
with the Group License Agreement), or (B) a League-related
entity relating to the following categories defined in the
same manner as was used in the audited financial reports for
Properties for the year ended July 31, 1997: (x) licensing;
and/or (y) a League-related entity's representation of, and
services performed for, third parties. For purposes of the
foregoing sentence, "third parties" refers to persons or
entities that are not owned or controlled by persons or
entities that own a majority interest in or otherwise control
an NBA Team or, if such third party is a Related Party,
proceeds received by the League-related entity shall not be
included in BRI if representation of such Related Party does
not relate either to such entity's NBA ownership or NBA
Players;
(xvii) monies collected from team-related fundraising for
charitable purposes or other charitable activities, other than
monies paid pursuant to Team sponsorship agreements that
are included in BRI pursuant to Section 1(a)(1)(v) above;
and
(xviii) proceeds solely related to the NBADL and other leagues,
teams and basketball organizations (e.g., an international
league) that do not involve the playing of basketball by any
then-current NBA players;
(xix) proceeds from the leasing or use of any Team physical
assets (e.g., a Team plane); and
(xx) any thing of value received from a concessionaire, food
service vendor or other third party equipment or serviceprovider that, if received in kind, is installed in an NBA
arena or, if received in cash, is directed to defraying the
costs of the construction or substantial renovation of an
NBA arena.
(3) The parties agree that (i) in determining whether a category
or source of revenue or proceeds constitutes BRI:
(A) consideration shall be given to whether such category or
source is more similar in kind or nature to the included categories
and sources listed in Section 1(a)(1)(i) through (xii) above, on the
one hand, or to the excluded categories and sources listed in
Section 1(a)(2)(i) through (xx) above, on the other; and, (B) no
inference may be drawn from the fact that such category or
source was not included in the categories and sources listed in
Section 1(a)(1)(i) through (xii) above, or the fact that such
category or source was not included in the categories and sources
listed in Sections 1(a)(2)(i) through (xx) above; and (ii) in any
proceeding involving a dispute over (A) the includability or
categorization of any revenue or expense item for BRI purposes;
(B) the amount to be included in or deducted from BRI with
respect to any revenue or expense item; or (C) the accounting
methodology used by the Accountants in connection with any
audit of BRI, the parties may refer to the past practice of the
parties or the Accountants in connection with the Audit Reports
for any of the 1999-2000 through 2010-11 Salary Cap Years;
provided, however, that no reference may be made to the past
practice of the parties or the Accountants with respect to any
source or category of revenue or expense that was included on the
"open issues" list prepared by the Accountants in connection with
any of such Audit Reports; provided, further, that any such past
practice shall be superseded to the extent changed or clarified by
the terms of this Agreement.
(4) The parties agree that, with respect to any lease entered into
after the date of this Agreement between a Team (or a Related
Party) and an arena that is not a Related Party, the Accountants
may attribute to the Team (or a Related Party) for purposes of
computing BRI for a Salary Cap Year portions of arena revenues
received by the arena or its related entities that would be included
in BRI if received by the Team (or a Related Party) to thefollowing extent: in the event of a renewal, extension or
renegotiation of a lease between the same parties, or a new lease
entered into by a Team (or a Related Party) with an arena that is
not a Related Party, the Team will be deemed to receive in the
first Salary Cap Year covered by the new lease or by the renewal,
extension or renegotiation of the existing lease (as the case may
be) the greater of (i) the amount of such revenues that the Team
or the Related Party in fact receives under the lease or, (ii) if in the
opinion of the Accountants, the Team (and/or the Related Party)
is receiving substantially less than fair market value as determined
by the Accountants (taking into account factors such as the rent
paid by the Team or the Related Party, the number and identity of
other major tenants in the arena, market conditions, the extent to
which arena revenues are used to fund construction or
renovations of the arena, and comparable lease arrangements in
the NBA), an amount determined by the Accountants to
constitute the fair market value of the revenues that a tenant, in
the same circumstances as the Team or Related Party, would
receive for such Salary Cap Year. In either of the preceding cases,
the Accountants will also determine the amount to be included in
BRI for Salary Cap Years beyond the first Salary Cap Year.
(5) (i) In no event shall the same revenues be included in BRI,
directly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result
of changes in accounting methods or practices), the purpose
of this provision being to preclude the double-counting of
revenues, whether in the same or in multiple Salary Cap
Years.
(ii) In no event shall the same expenses be deducted from BRI,
directly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result
of changes in accounting methods or practices), the purpose
of this provision being to preclude the double-counting of
expenses, whether in the same or in multiple Salary Cap
Years.
(6) Subject to Section 11 below (Players Association Audit
Rights):
(i) With respect to expenses incurred in connection with all
proceeds coming within Section 1(a)(1)(v) above, allreported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be
reasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not be
the subject of the accounting procedures set forth in
Section 10 below. Such expenses shall be disallowed,
however, to the extent that they exceed the ratio of League-
wide reported expenses to League-wide reported revenues
(the "Expense Ratio") for that category of revenues set
forth in Exhibit D hereto.
(ii) With respect to expenses incurred in connection with all
proceeds coming within Section 1(a)(ix) above that are
consistent with the types and categories of expenses
incurred by Properties as reflected in the audited financial
reports of Properties for the year ended July 31, 1994, (1) all
such reported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be
reasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not be
the subject of the accounting procedures set forth in
Section 10 below, but (2) such expenses shall be disallowed
to the extent they exceed the Expense Ratio for the category
of revenues set forth in Exhibit D hereto.
(iii) With respect to the NBA Store (the "Store") and any other
new venture or business (whether or not involving the
creation of a new entity) undertaken by the NBA,
Properties, Media Ventures, or any other League-related
entity requiring significant capital investment or start-up
costs ("New Venture"), the League-related entities shall be
able to deduct from BRI reasonable and customary
expenses related thereto, including, but not be limited to,
cost of goods sold, sales tax, all reasonable operating
expenses of the Store or New Venture (including, but not
limited to, salaries and benefits directly related to the
operations of the Store or New Venture, promotional and
advertising costs, rent, direct overhead, general and
administrative expenses of the Store or New Venture),
reasonable financing costs and amortization of capital
improvements and start-up costs; provided, however, that in
no event shall the expenses attributable to the Store or New
Venture cause the amount included in BRI for the Store orNew Venture to be less than zero (0) for any Salary Cap
Year.
(iv) With respect to new categories of revenue that may be
included in BRI during the term of this Agreement (other
than revenues attributable to the Store or a New Venture),
the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, other League-related
entities, NBA Teams and Related Parties shall be able to
deduct all expenses that the parties agree (or, in the absence
of such agreement, that the Accountants determine) are
reasonable and customary, provided, however, that if a new
category of revenue is substantially similar to the type of
revenues described in Section 1(a)(1)(i) and (iv) above, the
expenses attributable to such new category of revenue shall
be deductible only to the extent contemplated by such
subsections.
(7) It is acknowledged by the parties hereto that for purposes of
determining BRI:
(i) Some NBA Teams have engaged or may engage in
transactions with third parties that control, or own at least
fifty percent (50%) of, the NBA Team or that are controlled
or owned at least fifty percent (50%) by the persons or
entities controlling or owning at least fifty percent (50%) of
the NBA Team (such third parties are referred to in this
Agreement as a "Related Party"), and Related Parties
themselves engage in transactions with third parties that
may result in a Related Party's receipt of revenues that
constitute BRI. (Any entity that was an "entity related to an
NBA team" as defined by Article VII, Section 1(a)(4)(i) of
the September 18, 1995 Collective Bargaining Agreement
between the NBA and the Players Association (the "1995
CBA") shall be deemed a Related Party under this
Agreement for so long as such entity continues to be an
entity related to an NBA Team within the meaning of the
1995 CBA.) As provided in Section 1(a)(1) above, the
relevant proceeds received by any Related Party that come
within such subsection and that relate to such Related
Party's Team shall be included in BRI. However, except in
connection with telecast agreements (which are subject toSection 1(a)(7)(ii) below), with respect to any such revenues
or proceeds retained or received by a Related Party (other
than arena revenues that relate to such Related Party's Team
including, but not limited to, in-arena sales of novelties and
concessions, NBA game parking, arena club revenues, suite
and seat revenues and fixed and temporary in-arena signage,
which shall be included in BRI as if received by the Team),
or by a Team pursuant to a transaction with a Related Party,
such revenues or proceeds shall be included in BRI only to
the extent that the NBA and the Players Association agree
or, if they fail to agree, the Accountants shall reasonably
determine the amount, if any, of such revenues or proceeds
to attribute to the Team (taking into account factors such as
the nature of the transaction, arrangement and/or
relationship between the Team and the Related Party or
between the Related Party and a third party, any amounts
included in BRI with respect to other Teams (or Related
Parties) that have entered into comparable transactions,
arrangements and/or relationships with third parties, market
conditions, the nature of any services or activities performed
by the Related Party for, or in connection with, the
generation of revenues or proceeds and the amount of
revenues or proceeds that the Related Party would be
expected to retain or receive with respect to comparable
transactions, arrangements and/or relationships with third
parties), and the amount so attributed shall be the only
amount included in BRI. To the extent that the amount of
such proceeds to be included in BRI cannot reasonably be
determined with respect to any particular transaction, the
Accountants shall determine a reasonable amount with
respect to such transaction, which shall be included in BRI.
(In the event the Accountants refuse to make any such
determination, such determination shall be made by a jointly
selected expert with respect to any such transaction.)
Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall BRI
include consideration paid to a Related Party in connection
with rights acquired by such Related Party from a Team for
fair market value, even if such consideration relates to NBA
games or NBA-related activities (including, by way of
example and not limitation, advertising revenue orsubscriber fees earned by a Related Party television network
that relate, directly or indirectly, to the telecast of NBA
games licensed to the television network by a Team).
(ii) In the event that, following the execution of this
Agreement, a Team (other than the New York Knicks
("Knicks")) enters into a local or regional telecast agreement
with a Related Party, a copy of such agreement shall be
provided to the Players Association within ten (10) days of
approval of such agreement by the NBA. The Players
Association and the NBA shall each have the right, not later
than ten (10) days following the date on which the Players
Association receives a copy of such agreement, to submit
such agreement to a jointly-selected television valuation
expert or (in the absence of such agreement) determined in
accordance with the procedure set forth in this subsection
("TV Expert") for the limited purpose set forth in this
Section 1(a)(7)(ii). In the event that a party has so elected to
submit such agreement to a TV Expert and the parties have
not jointly selected a TV Expert within twenty (20) days
following the date on which the Players Association receives
a copy of such agreement, each party shall appoint its own
television valuation designee and the two designees so
appointed shall within ten (10) days of their appointment,
jointly select a third party to serve as the TV Expert. Such
TV Expert shall review such agreement to determine if the
aggregate amount to be paid to the Team by the Related
Party for the rights to telecast the Team's games pursuant to
such agreement is more than fifteen percent (15%) above or
more than fifteen percent (15%) below the fair market value
of such rights over the term of such agreement. In making
such determination, the TV Expert may take into account
factors such as the nature of the transaction, arrangement
and/or relationship between the Team and the Related
Party, any amounts included in BRI with respect to other
Teams (or Related Parties) that have entered into
comparable transactions, arrangements and/or relationships
with other programming licensors, market conditions, the
nature of any services or activities performed by the Related
Party for, or in connection with, the generation of revenuesor proceeds and the amount of revenues or proceeds that
the Related Party would be expected to retain or receive
with respect to comparable transactions, arrangements
and/or relationships with third parties; provided that in no
event shall BRI include consideration paid to a Related Party
in connection with rights acquired by such Related Party
from a Team for fair market value, even if such
consideration relates to NBA games or NBA-related
activities (including, by way of example and not limitation,
advertising revenue or subscriber fees earned by a Related
Party television network that relate, directly or indirectly, to
the telecast of NBA games licensed to the television
network by a Team). In the event that the TV Expert
determines that such aggregate amount is more than fifteen
percent (15%) above or below fair market value, the TV
Expert shall be instructed to submit to the parties the
amount for each Season of such agreement that he
determines reflects the fair market value of such rights and
such amounts, and no other amounts, shall be included in
BRI with respect to such agreement for each Salary Cap
Year covered by such agreement. Any determination made
by the TV Expert pursuant to either of the preceding two
sentences shall be submitted to the parties no later than
twenty (20) days from the date on which such agreement
was submitted to the TV Expert for his review. Any fees or
costs associated with the retention or determination of the
TV Expert shall be borne equally by the Players Association
and NBA. The Players Association and the TV Expert shall
maintain the confidentiality of any such agreement (and any
determination made by the TV expert in accordance with
this Section 1(a)(7)(ii)) pursuant to the terms of Section
11(c) below relating to confidentiality of BRI Audits.
(iii) With respect to the transactions listed below in this
Section 1(a)(7)(iii), the parties agree that, because the
proceeds attributable to these transactions cannot be
accurately ascertained, the following procedures shall be
used for each NBA Season in which MSG Network is a
Related Party of the Knicks (in the case of Section
1(a)(7)(iii)(A) below) and the Madison Square Garden arenais a Related Party of the Knicks (in the case of Section
1(a)(7)(iii)(B) below):
(A) New York Knicks transaction with MSG Network
regarding the sale of local media rights: BRI for the
Knicks for each NBA Season covered by this
Agreement shall include an amount equal to the net
proceeds included in BRI attributable to the Los
Angeles Lakers' sale, license or other conveyance of all
local media rights (including, but not limited to,
broadcast and cable television and radio) for such
NBA season.
(B) New York Knicks transactions with Related Parties
involving signage: BRI for the Knicks for the 1999-
2000 NBA Season shall include \$3,750,000 for
signage. In each subsequent Season covered by this
Agreement, this amount shall be increased (or
decreased, as the case may be) by the League-wide
percentage increase (or decrease) in signage as
determined in accordance with Section 1(a)(1)(v)
and (a)(1)(vi) above.
At such time as the MSG Network and/or the Madison
Square Garden Arena are no longer Related Parties, BRI for
the New York Knicks in the categories described in Section
1(a)(7)(iii)(A) and/or (B) above, as the case may be, shall not
be determined in accordance with the foregoing and will
instead be determined by the applicable provisions of
Section 1(a)(1) and (a)(7)(ii) above.
(8) In the event that, pursuant to the NBA's national broadcast,
national telecast and network cable television agreements, NBA
Teams receive revenue sharing proceeds that are attributable to
NBA game telecasts in more than one Salary Cap Year, such
proceeds shall be allocated over the same number of Salary Cap
Years (beginning with first Salary Cap Year after the Salary Cap
Year in which such proceeds are actually received) as the number
of Salary Cap Years in which such games were televised. Any
other contingent payments received by the NBA pursuant to such
agreements shall be included in BRI to the extent and in a manneragreed upon by the parties, or, if the parties cannot agree, in a
reasonable manner determined by the Accountants.
(9) The NBA and each NBA Team shall in good faith act and
use their commercially reasonable efforts to increase BRI for each
Salary Cap Year during the term of this Agreement. In the
exercise of such commercially reasonable efforts, the NBA and
each NBA Team shall be entitled to act in a manner consistent
with their reasonable business judgment and shall not (i) take any
action intended to benefit, at the expense of BRI, other
commercial activities (such as the WNBA and the NBADL)
unrelated to the performance of Players in NBA basketball games
or in NBA-related activities, or (ii) shift or forgo revenues
attributable to Salary Cap Years during the term of this
Agreement in exchange for revenues or benefits during Salary Cap
Years following the expiration of this Agreement (unless there is a
reasonable business justification unrelated to collective bargaining
for such shift or forgoing). There shall be no obligation on the
part of the NBA or any NBA Team to accelerate into Salary Cap
Years within the term of this Agreement revenues attributable to
Salary Cap Years following the expiration of this Agreement. In
evaluating compliance with this subsection, the parties and the
System Arbitrator shall consider and give substantial weight to the
reasonable business judgment of the NBA or the NBA Team but
no deference will be applied where the NBA is alleged to have
shifted or forgone revenues of \$350 million or more for the
purpose of securing leverage in collective bargaining, in which
case any finding of non-compliance shall require proof by a clear
preponderance of the evidence. The following is a list of
decisions in respect of which the business judgment of the NBA
or an NBA Team shall conclusively be deemed reasonable:
membership location; arena capacity or configuration; number
and location of games played; whether to outsource or operate a
line of business; and whether to accept or decline a sponsorship,
advertising or naming rights opportunity. The foregoing list shall
not limit in any manner the circumstances in which the business
judgment of the NBA or an NBA Team may be deemed
reasonable.(10) The parties agree that upon a finding by the System
Arbitrator (which, if appealed, is affirmed by the Appeals Panel)
that the NBA or an NBA Team (or a Related Party) has willfully
failed to provide to the Accountants information concerning
revenues or expenses material to the Accountants' preparation of
an Audit Report, and that such failure to provide information
resulted in an understatement of BRI of more than \$3,250,000
with respect to the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year (increasing by four
and one-half percent (4.5%) for each subsequent Salary Cap Year
of this Agreement, beginning with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year),
then the amount by which BRI was understated shall be included
in BRI in the Salary Cap Year in which such finding is made, with
interest accruing from the date of the Audit Report for the Salary
Cap Year in which such amount would have been included but
for such understatement, with interest (at a rate equal to the one
(1) year Treasury Bill rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on
the date of the issuance of such Audit Report). In addition, if any
Team, or if the NBA, violates the foregoing, it shall be fined \$3
million for its first violation during the term of this Agreement
and an additional \$1.5 million for each additional violation. (For
example, if a Team violates the foregoing for the first time, it shall
be fined \$3 million; if such Team violates the foregoing a second
time, it shall be fined \$4.5 million; and if such Team violates the
foregoing a third time, it shall be fined \$6 million.) Fifty percent
(50%) of any such fine amounts shall be remitted by the NBA to
an NBPA-Selected Charitable Organization (as defined in Article
VI, Section 6 above) and fifty percent (50%) shall be remitted by
the NBA to a Section 501(c)(3) organization selected by the NBA.
(11) Neither the NBA or a League-related entity nor a Team or a
Related Party will enter into any lease or other agreement
providing for the receipt of revenues includable in BRI that
contains provisions that purport to limit access of the
Accountants to the books and records of the NBA, such League-
related entity, such Team, or such Related Party in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or that would
preclude the calculation of revenues (if any) to be included in BRI
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1(a)(1)(xii) above.(12) Premium payments made by a Team for any insurance that, if
paid, would be includable in BRI pursuant to Section 1(a)(2)(ix)
above, shall be deducted from such Team's BRI for the Salary
Cap Year in which any such insurance recovery is received.
(13) Equity Transactions.
(i) The value of equity securities received by NBA-related
entities (as defined in Section 1(a)(2) above) in entities that
were not NBA-related entities prior to such receipt, to the
extent otherwise constituting BRI under this Agreement,
shall be included in BRI as follows:
(A) if the equity securities (including contingent securities,
as defined below) are Publicly Tradable when received,
the Publicly Traded Value of those securities will be
included in BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in
which they are received;
(B) if the equity securities consist of options, warrants,
convertible securities or similar securities ("contingent
securities"), and (x) those contingent securities are
sold, the Net Proceeds will be included in BRI
commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which the sale
occurs, or (y) those contingent securities are exercised
or converted into other securities that are or become
Publicly Tradable, the Publicly Traded Value of the
resulting securities (net of any exercise or conversion
price and taxes, as determined below) will be included
in BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which
the exercise or conversion occurs (if the resulting
securities were Publicly Tradable at that time) or in the
Salary Cap Year in which the resulting securities later
become Publicly Tradable, whichever is first;
(C) if the equity securities (including contingent securities
and any securities resulting from the exercise or
conversion of contingent securities) are not Publicly
Tradable at the time of receipt (or, in the case of
contingent securities, at the time of exercise or
conversion), no BRI value shall be attributable to suchsecurities until they become Publicly Tradable or are
sold or otherwise transferred for consideration other
than securities that are not Publicly Tradable,
whichever is first, at which time the Publicly Traded
Value or Net Proceeds, as applicable, will be included
in BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which
such event occurs; or
(D) notwithstanding the foregoing, if any contingent
securities are exercisable or convertible into securities
that are or become Publicly Tradable, but those
contingent securities are not exercised or converted
within one (1) year of any such right, the Players
Association shall have the right, by written notice to
the NBA, to have the Publicly Traded Value of such
securities included in BRI as if those contingent
securities had been exercised or converted on the date
of such notice (net of any exercise or conversion price
and taxes, as determined below).
(ii) For purposes of this Section 1(a)(13), (A) "Publicly
Tradable" means (x) the applicable equity securities have
been registered for sale under applicable state, federal and
foreign laws, are listed and tradable on a generally
recognized stock exchange or in the over-the-counter
market, or (y) the applicable equity securities can be readily
purchased and sold on a nationally recognized secondary
market (e.g., without limitation on any example, shares in
"Facebook" as of the date of this Agreement), and in each
case under (x) and (y), any contractual or other prohibition
or limitation on sale would not preclude a sale; (B) "Publicly
Traded Value" means the weighted average daily trading
price of the applicable equity securities for the thirty (30)
trading days (x) preceding the date of receipt if the securities
are Publicly Tradable prior to that date or (y) following the
date they become Publicly Tradable; provided that if such
equity securities are sold during the Salary Cap Year in
which their Publicly Traded Value is first included in BRI,
the "Publicly Traded Value" of such equity securities shall
be the Net Proceeds from such sale; (C) "Net Proceeds"means the proceeds received by the selling entity from the
applicable sale, net of commissions and reasonable expenses
relating to such sale, any exercise or conversion price with
respect to securities resulting from the exercise or
conversion of contingent securities, and any applicable taxes
of the selling entity (or if the selling entity is a pass-through
entity for income tax purposes, such entity's owners), which
shall be determined using an assumed tax rate equivalent to
the highest marginal combined federal, state and local tax
rate that would be applicable in New York City; and (D) a
sale of equity securities shall not be subject to inclusion in
BRI if the sale is part of a larger transaction in which
(x) BRI has been fully accounted for or (y) all or
substantially all of the assets of an NBA-related entity or
business unit thereof are sold and such equity securities do
not represent a majority of the value in such transaction. In
all cases, the Publicly Traded Value of, or Net Proceeds
from, the applicable equity securities will be included in BRI
over a seven (7) year amortization period (inclusive of the
Salary Cap Year in which such Publicly Traded Value is first
included in BRI), even if such equity securities are sold
during such seven (7) year period.
(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, (A) in no event shall the value
of, or proceeds or distributions from, equity securities in
NBA-related entities be included in BRI, and (B) the value
of, or proceeds or distributions from, equity securities in
non-NBA-related entities shall be included in BRI
exclusively pursuant to this Section 1(a)(13), and only once
under the applicable provision of Section 1(a)(13)(i) above.
(b) Accounting Methods/Lump Sum Payments.
(1) Subject to Sections 1(b)(2) and (b)(3) below, and any
provision hereof that expressly provides for an alternative
accounting treatment, BRI for each Salary Cap Year shall be
calculated exclusively pursuant to the accrual method of financial
accounting (and not, for any purpose, the cash method of
financial accounting) and in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. By way of example,
and not limitation, in the event a team receives a signing bonus inconsideration for its agreement to enter into a five (5) year
contract for the local telecast of its games, such signing bonus
shall be amortized in equal annual amounts over the five (5) Salary
Cap Years covered by such television contract.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in the case of luxury suites and
premium seat licenses, in no event shall the amortization period
for any lump sum payment exceed seven (7) years.
(3) Any payments that constitute BRI and that are subject to
being repaid to the payor under certain circumstances (the
"Contingencies") shall constitute BRI in the Salary Cap Year in
which such payments would have been earned but for the
Contingencies unless, at the time of such payments, the
Contingencies under which the payments would be repaid are
likely to occur, in which case the payments will not be included in
BRI unless and until such time as the Contingencies under which
such repayments would be made do not occur or are not likely to
occur. In the event that a payment that has been included in BRI
is subsequently repaid, BRI shall be reduced by the amount of
such repayment in the Salary Cap Year in which such repayment is
made. In any proceeding commenced before the System
Arbitrator relating to the terms of this Section 1(b)(3), the NBA
will bear the burden of demonstrating that the applicable
Contingencies are likely to occur.
(c) "Projected BRI" for a Salary Cap Year means the amount
determined as follows: Prior to the start of each Salary Cap Year (other
than the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year), the NBA and the Players Association
shall meet for the purpose of agreeing upon Projected BRI for that Salary
Cap Year. In the absence of an agreement of the parties otherwise on or
prior to the last day of the Moratorium Period of the applicable Salary Cap
Year, Projected BRI for such Salary Cap Year shall be the sum of amounts
determined in accordance with the following:
(1) With respect to BRI sources other than national broadcast,
national telecast or network cable television contracts, Projected
BRI shall include BRI for the preceding Salary Cap Year,
increased by four and one-half percent (4.5%). For purposes of
this Section 1(c)(1), a contract between or among any League-related entities and/or Teams shall not be considered national
broadcast, national telecast or network cable television contracts.
(2) With respect to national broadcast, national telecast or
network cable television contracts including the NBA/ABC
agreement dated June 27, 2007 ("NBA/ABC Agreement") (a copy
of which has been provided to the Players Association) and the
NBA/TBS agreement, dated June 27, 2007 ("NBA/TBS
Agreement") (a copy of which has been provided to the Players
Association), and national broadcast, national telecast or network
cable television contracts covering Seasons that succeed the
Seasons covered by the NBA/ABC and NBA/TBS Agreements
("Successor Agreements") (copies of which shall be provided to
the Players Association within ten (10) days of execution),
Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year shall include (i) the rights
fees or other non-contingent payments stated in such contracts
with respect to the Season covered by such Salary Cap Year (as
such rights fees or non-contingent payments may be adjusted by
agreement of the parties to such contracts); (ii) the amounts of
revenue sharing proceeds, if any, that are includable in BRI for
such Salary Cap Year pursuant to Section 1(a)(8) above; (iii) the
amounts with respect to contingent payments (other than revenue
sharing proceeds), if any, attributable to Salary Cap Years covered
by this Agreement in Successor Agreements as such amounts are
agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties do not reach
agreement, by the Accountants; and (iv) the amount included in
BRI for the preceding Salary Cap Year with respect to the value of
advertising or promotional time provided to the NBA as part of
the NBA/ABC and NBA/TBS Agreements (or any Successor
Agreements) that is used to promote the WNBA or for any
purpose other than those listed in Section 1(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(D).
(d) "Local Expansion Team BRI" means the BRI of the Expansion
Teams during their first two (2) Seasons, but not including the Expansion
Teams' share of League-wide revenues that are otherwise included in BRI
(including, but not limited to, their share of national television, cable, radio
and other broadcast revenues).
(e) "Projected Local Expansion Team BRI" means Local Expansion
Team BRI for the immediately preceding Season, increased by four and
one-half percent (4.5%).(f) "Interim Projected BRI" means a projection of BRI for a Salary
Cap Year using Estimated BRI in place of BRI for the previous Salary Cap
Year.
(g) "Barter" means to trade by exchanging one commodity, service or
other non-cash item for another.
(h) "Estimated Total Benefits" means the estimate of Total Benefits
for a Salary Cap Year as set forth in the Interim Audit Report (as defined
in Section 10(a) below) for such Salary Cap Year.
(i) "Estimated Total Salaries" means the estimate of Total Salaries for
a Salary Cap Year as set forth in the Interim Audit Report for such Salary
Cap Year.
(j) "Estimated Total Salaries and Benefits" means the sum of
Estimated Total Benefits and Estimated Total Salaries for a Salary Cap
Year as set forth in the Interim Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.
(k) "Estimated BRI" means the estimate of BRI for a Salary Cap Year
as set forth in the Interim Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.
Section 2. Calculation of Salary Cap and Minimum Team Salary.
(a) Salary Cap.
(1) For each Salary Cap Year during the term of this Agreement,
there shall be a Salary Cap. The Salary Cap for the 2011-12 Salary
Cap Year will equal \$58.044 million. The Salary Cap for the 2012-
13 Salary Cap Year will equal the greater of: (i) Projected BRI for
such Salary Cap Year multiplied by forty-four and seventy-four
one hundredths percent (44.74%), less Projected Benefits (as
defined in Article IV, Section 9) for such Salary Cap Year, divided
by the number of Teams scheduled to play in the NBA during
such Salary Cap Year, other than Expansion Teams during their
first two Salary Cap Years in the NBA; or (ii) \$58.044 million.
Subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 2(d) below,
commencing with the 2013-14 Salary Cap Year, the Salary Cap for
each Salary Cap Year covered by the Term of this Agreement will
equal forty-four and seventy-four one hundredths percent
(44.74%) of Projected BRI for such Salary Cap Year, lessProjected Benefits for such Salary Cap Year, divided by the
number of Teams scheduled to play in the NBA during such
Salary Cap Year, other than Expansion Teams during their first
two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA.
(2) Notwithstanding Section 2(a)(1) above, in the event that,
subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 2(d) below,
Projected BRI for any Salary Cap Year in which one or more
Expansion Teams is scheduled to play its second Season, plus
Projected Local Expansion Team BRI for such Salary Cap Year,
multiplied by the applicable percentage of Projected BRI set forth
in Section 2(a)(1) above, less Projected Benefits for such Salary
Cap Year (including for the Expansion Team(s)), divided by the
number of Teams scheduled to play in the NBA during such
Salary Cap Year (including the Expansion Team(s)), exceeds the
Salary Cap calculated in accordance with Section 2(a)(1) above,
the Salary Cap shall equal the amount calculated pursuant to this
Section 2(a)(2).
(3) The Salary Cap for a Salary Cap Year will be in effect
commencing on the day following the last day of the Moratorium
Period in such Salary Cap Year and shall continue through and
including the last day of the Moratorium Period in the next Salary
Cap Year.
(4) In the event that the Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year has
not been completed as of the last day of the Moratorium Period
immediately following the end of such Salary Cap Year, and the
NBA and the Players Association have not reached an agreement
on Projected BRI and Projected Benefits pursuant to Article VII,
Section 1 and Article IV, Section 9 for the Salary Cap Year that
commenced on the immediately preceding July 1, then the Salary
Cap for the Salary Cap Year that commenced on such
immediately preceding July 1 will be calculated pursuant to
Section 2(a)(1)-(2) above, except that Interim Projected BRI shall
be utilized instead of Projected BRI, Estimated BRI shall be
utilized instead of BRI and Estimated Total Salaries and Benefits
shall be utilized instead of Total Salaries and Benefits, for all
purposes under this Section 2 including, without limitation, the
adjustments set forth in Section 2(d) below. In the event that the
Interim Audit Report for the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year not beencompleted as of the last day of the Moratorium Period
immediately following the end of such Salary Cap Year and the
NBA and Players Association have not reached agreement on
Projected BRI and Projected Benefits pursuant to Article VII,
Section 1 and Article IV, Section 9, then the Salary Cap for the
2012-13 Salary Cap Year shall, until such Interim Audit Report is
completed, be \$58.044 million. In the event that the Interim
Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year, beginning with the 2012-13
Salary Cap Year, has not been completed as of the last day of the
Moratorium Period immediately following the end of such Salary
Cap Year, and the NBA and Players Association have not reached
agreement on Projected BRI and Projected Benefits pursuant to
Article VII, Section 1 and Article IV, Section 9, then the Salary
Cap for the Salary Cap Year that commenced on the immediately
preceding July 1 shall, until such Interim Audit Report is
completed, be an amount that would have been the Salary Cap for
the preceding Salary Cap Year had Projected BRI or Interim
Projected BRI, as the case may be, for such preceding Salary Cap
Year included, with respect to the NBA's national broadcast,
national telecast or network cable television contracts, the rights
fees or other non-contingent payments stated in such contracts
for the Season following the Season covered by such preceding
Salary Cap Year instead of for the Season covered by such
preceding Salary Cap Year.
(b) Minimum Team Salary.
(1) For the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year, there shall be a Minimum
Team Salary equal to \$46.435 million. For the 2012-13 Salary Cap
Year, there shall be a Minimum Team Salary equal to eighty-five
percent (85%) of the Salary Cap for such Salary Cap Year. For
each Salary Cap Year thereafter during the term of this
Agreement, there shall be a Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety
percent (90%) of the Salary Cap for such Salary Cap Year.
(2) In the event that a Team's Team Salary for a Salary Cap Year
as of the start of the Team's last Regular Season game of that
Salary Cap Year is less than the applicable Minimum Team Salary
for that Salary Cap Year, the NBA shall cause such Team to make
payments equal to the shortfall (to be disbursed to the players on
such Team pro rata or in accordance with such other formula asmay be reasonably determined by the Players Association). The
Players Association shall provide the NBA with its proposed
distribution of any such shortfall within thirty (30) days after the
completion of the Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year. The
NBA shall cause the Team to make the required payments, less all
amounts required to be withheld be any governmental authority,
within ten (10) business days after receipt of the proposed
distribution from the Players Association in accordance with the
preceding sentence. For purposes of this Section 2(b), and
subject to subsection (4) below, a Team's Team Salary for a Salary
Cap Year shall be calculated in the same manner as Team Salary is
calculated by the Accountants for purposes of computing Total
Salaries and Benefits in the Audit Report (as defined in Section
10(a)(1) below).
(3) Nothing contained herein shall preclude a Team from having
a Team Salary in excess of the Minimum Team Salary, provided
that the Team's Team Salary does not exceed the Salary Cap plus
any additional amounts authorized pursuant to the Exceptions set
forth in this Article VII.
(4) For purposes of determining whether a Team has met its
Minimum Team Salary obligation for a Salary Cap Year, the
Team's Team Salary shall include any Salary in respect of such
Salary Cap Year that is excluded from the Team's Team Salary
pursuant to Section 4(h) and 12(f)(5) below.
(c) Expansion Team Salary Caps and Minimum Team Salaries.
Expansion Teams shall have the same Salary Caps and Minimum Team
Salaries as all other Teams, except as follows:
(1) During the first Salary Cap Year in which it begins play, an
Expansion Team shall have a Salary Cap equal to sixty six and
two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the Salary Cap applicable to all
other Teams (the "First Year Expansion Team Salary Cap"); and
shall have a Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety percent (90%)
of the First Year Expansion Team Salary Cap (except that if such
Salary Cap Year is the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year, then the
Expansion Team shall have a Minimum Team Salary equal to
eighty-five percent (85%) of the First Year Expansion Team
Salary Cap).(2) During the second Salary Cap Year in which it begins play,
an Expansion Team shall have a Salary Cap equal to eighty
percent (80%) of the Salary Cap applicable to all other Teams (the
"Second Year Expansion Team Salary Cap"); and shall have a
Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety percent (90%) of the
Second Year Expansion Team Salary Cap.
(d) Adjustments to Salary Cap and Minimum Team Salary.
(1) In the event that Total Salaries and Benefits for any Salary
Cap Year beginning with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year are less
than the Designated Share (as defined in Section 12(b)(3) below)
for such Salary Cap Year, then the Salary Cap for the subsequent
Salary Cap Year shall be increased by the amount of the shortfall
divided by the number of Teams in the NBA during such
subsequent Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their
first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA).
(2) In the event that there is an Overage (as defined in Section
12(a)(14) below) in any Salary Cap Year beginning with the 2012-
13 Salary Cap Year, then the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary
Cap Year shall be adjusted as follows:
(i) If the amount of the Overage in a Salary Cap Year is equal
to or less than six percent (6%) of Total Salaries and
Benefits, then no adjustments shall be made to the Salary
Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year.
(ii) If the amount of the Overage in a Salary Cap Year equals
more than six percent (6%) of Total Salaries and Benefits,
then the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year shall
be reduced by an amount to be calculated as follows:
STEP 1: Subtract six percent (6%) of Total Salaries and
Benefits from the Overage.
STEP 2: If Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year does not
exceed BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year by
more than eight percent (8%) of BRI for the
prior Salary Cap Year or the amount of the
Overage described above exceeds nine percent(9%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then divide
the result of Step 1 by the number of Teams in
the NBA during the subsequent Salary Cap Year
(other than Expansion Teams in their first two
(2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The result of
this calculation is the amount of the reduction in
the Salary Cap for such subsequent Salary Cap
Year, and no further steps are required.
If Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year exceeds
BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year by more than
eight percent (8%) of BRI for the prior Salary
Cap Year and the amount of the Overage
described above does not exceed nine percent
(9%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then proceed
to Step 3.
STEP 3: Subtract BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year from
Projected BRI for the Salary Cap Year.
STEP 4: Subtract eight percent (8%) of BRI for the prior
Salary Cap Year from the result of Step 3.
STEP 5: Multiply the result of Step 4 by forty-four and
seventy-four one hundredths percent (44.74%).
STEP 6: Subtract the result of Step 5 from the result of
Step 1. If the result of this step is less than zero,
then no adjustments shall be made to the Salary
Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year, and no
further steps are required.
STEP 7: Divide the result of Step 6 by the number of
Teams in the NBA during such subsequent Salary
Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their
first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The
result of this step is the amount of the reduction
in the Salary Cap for such subsequent Salary Cap
Year.Example: Assume Total Salaries and Benefits for the 2013-14 Season are \$2.27
billion and the Designated Share is \$2.1 billion resulting in an Overage of \$170
million (which equals 7.5% of Total Salaries and Benefits). Assume Projected BRI for
the 2014-15 Season (\$4.41 billion) exceeds actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2
billion) by 5%. Assume there are 30 Teams in the NBA in 2014-15. The Salary
Cap for the 2014-15 Season would be reduced by \$1.1 million ((7.5% of Total
Salaries and Benefits (\$170 million) less 6% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$136
million)) divided by 30).
Example: Same Total Salaries and Benefits as in the prior example, except
assume Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season (\$4.578 billion) exceeds actual BRI for
the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2 billion) by 9%. The Salary Cap for the 2014-15 Season
would be reduced by \$0.50 million (\$34 million (the Overage of 7.5% of Total Salaries
and Benefits (\$170 million) less 6% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$136 million)),
less \$19 million (i.e., the difference between (x) Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season
(\$4.578 billion) less actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2 billion) (i.e., \$378
million) and (y) 8% of actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (i.e., \$336 million) -- a
difference of \$42 million -- multiplied by 44.74%), divided by 30).
(3) In the event that the Salary Cap for a Salary Cap Year is
calculated based upon an Interim Audit Report for the prior
Salary Cap Year in accordance with Section 2(a)(4) above and BRI
and Total Salaries and Benefits as set forth in the Audit Report
for the prior Salary Cap Year are different from those in the
Interim Audit Report such that the Salary Cap would have been
different from that based upon the Interim Audit Report, any
such difference in the Salary Cap shall be debited or credited, as
the case may be, to the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap
Year, except that, with respect to the 2020-21 Salary Cap Year (or,
in the alternative, if either the NBA or Players Association
exercises its option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Article XXXIX, the 2016-17 Salary Cap Year) any such
differences shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to the
Salary Cap for the then current Salary Cap Year, in all such cases
with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate
as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the issuance
of the Interim Audit Report).
(e) Guarantee. In the event that for any Salary Cap Year Total
Salaries and Benefits is less than the Designated Share (as defined in
Section 12(b)(3) below) for such Salary Cap Year, the difference shall bepaid by the NBA to the Players Association no later than thirty (30) days
following the completion of the Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year for
distribution to all NBA players who were on an NBA roster during the
Season covered by such Salary Cap Year on such proportional basis as may
be reasonably determined by the Players Association. The Players
Association shall provide the NBA with its proposed distribution of any
such guarantee payment within thirty (30) days after the completion of the
Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.
Section 3. Determination of Salary.
For the purposes of determining a player's Salary with respect to a
Salary Cap Year, the following rules shall apply:
(a) Deferred Compensation.
(1) General Rule: All Player Contracts entered into, extended or
renegotiated after the date of this Agreement shall specify the
Season(s) in which any Deferred Compensation is earned.
Deferred Compensation shall be included in a player's Salary for
the Salary Cap Year encompassing the Season in which such
Deferred Compensation is earned.
(2) Over 36 Rule: The following provisions shall apply to any
Player Contract entered into, extended, or renegotiated that,
beginning with the date such Contract, Extension or
Renegotiation is signed, covers four (4) or more Seasons,
including one (1) or more Seasons commencing after such player
will reach or has reached age thirty-six (36) (an "Over 36
Contract"):
(i) Except as provided in Section 3(a)(2)(ii)-(iii) below, the
aggregate Salaries in an Over 36 Contract for Salary Cap
Years commencing with the fourth Salary Cap Year of such
Over 36 Contract or the first Salary Cap Year that covers a
Season that follows the player's 36th birthday, whichever is
later, shall be attributed to the prior Salary Cap Years pro
rata on the basis of the Salaries for such prior Salary Cap
Years.(ii) If a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent who is age 33 or 34
enters into an Over 36 Contract with his Prior Team
covering five (5) Seasons, the Salary in such Over 36
Contract for the fifth Salary Cap Year shall be attributed to
the prior Salary Cap Years pro rata on the basis of the
Salaries for such prior Salary Cap Years. For purposes of
this Section 3(a)(2)(ii), a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent who
(x) enters into an Over 36 Contract with his Prior Team
prior to October 1 of a Salary Cap Year, (y) is age 32 at the
time he enters into the Contract, and (z) will turn age 33 on
or before such October 1 shall be deemed to be 33 at the
time he enters into such Over 36 Contract.
(iii) For each Salary Cap Year of an Over 36 Contract beginning
with the second Salary Cap Year prior to the First Zero Year
(as defined in Section 3(a)(2)(vi) below), if the player has not
been placed on waivers as of the July 1 of such Salary Cap
Year, then the Salaries of the player for such Salary Cap
Year and the subsequent two (2) or fewer Salary Cap Years
covered by the Contract (including any Zero Year (as
defined in Section 3(a)(2)(vi) below)) shall, on such July 1,
be aggregated and attributed in equal shares to each of such
three (3) or fewer Salary Cap Years.
(iv) Notwithstanding Section 3(a)(2)(i) above, there shall be no
re-allocation of Salaries pursuant to this Section 3(a)(2) for
any Contract between a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent and
his Prior Team covering four (4) or fewer Seasons entered
into by a player at age 33 or 34.
(v) For purposes of determining whether a Contract is an Over
36 Contract pursuant to this Section 3(a)(2) only, Seasons
shall be deemed to commence on October 1 and conclude
on the last day of the Salary Cap Year.
(vi) "Zero Year" means, with respect to an Over 36 Contract,
any Salary Cap Year in which the Salary called for under the
Contract has been attributed, in accordance with Section
3(a)(2)(i), (ii) or (iii) above, to prior Salary Cap Years of the
Contract. "First Zero Year" means, with respect to an Over
36 Contract, the earliest Salary Cap Year in which the Salarycalled for under the Contract has been attributed, in
accordance with Section 3(a)(2)(i), (ii) or (iii) above, to prior
Salary Cap Years of the Contract.
(vii) For purposes of this subsection (a)(2), a player (A) whose
birthday is on a date during the Moratorium Period and
(B) who signs a Contract, Extension or Renegotiation on or
before the fifth day following the conclusion of the
Moratorium Period shall be treated as if his age, at the time
of such signing, was his age on the immediately preceding
June 30.
(b) Signing Bonuses.
(1) Amounts Treated as Signing Bonuses: For purposes of
determining a player's Salary, the term "signing bonus" shall
include:
(i) any amount provided for in a Player Contract that is earned
upon the signing of such Contract;
(ii) at the time of a trade of a Player Contract, any amount that,
under the terms of the Contract, is earned in the form of a
bonus upon the trade of the Contract; and
(iii) payments in excess of the Excluded International Player
Payment Amount with respect to foreign players, in
accordance with Section 3(e) below.
(2) Proration: Any signing bonus contained in a Player Contract
shall be allocated over the number of Salary Cap Years (or over
the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Years in the case
of a signing bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above) covered
by such Contract in proportion to the percentage of Base
Compensation in each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of
allocation, is protected for lack of skill; provided, however, that if
the Player Contract provides for an Early Termination Option
("ETO"), the foregoing allocation shall be performed only over
Salary Cap Years that precede the Effective Season of such ETO.
In the event that, at the time of allocation, none of the Base
Compensation provided for by a Player Contract (or none of thethen-current or remaining Base Compensation in the case of a
signing bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above) is protected
for lack of skill, then the entire amount of the signing bonus shall
be allocated to the first Salary Cap Year of the Contract (or, in the
case of a signing bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above, the
Salary Cap Year during which the player's Contract is traded).
(3) Extensions:
(i) In the event that a Team with a Team Salary at or over the
Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or contains
a signing bonus, such signing bonus shall be paid no sooner
than the first day of the first Salary Cap Year covered by the
extended term and shall be allocated, in equal parts, over the
number of Salary Cap Years covered by the extended term
in proportion to the percentage of Base Compensation in
each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of allocation, is
protected for lack of skill. In the event that, at the time of
the allocation, none of the Base Compensation provided for
during the extended term is protected for lack of skill, then
the entire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to
the first Salary Cap Year of the extended term.
(ii) A Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may enter
into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus
to be paid at any time during the Contract's original or
extended term. In the event that a Team with a Team Salary
below the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for
or contains a signing bonus to be paid no sooner than the
first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by such extended
term, the bonus shall be allocated in accordance with the
proration rules set forth in Section 3(b)(3)(i) above. In the
event a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap
enters into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing
bonus to be paid prior to the first day of the first Salary Cap
Year covered by the extended term, the following rules shall
apply:
(A) The signing bonus shall be allocated over the
remaining Salary Cap Years (including the then-
current Salary Cap Year) under the original term of theContract and the extended term in proportion to the
percentage of Base Compensation in each such Salary
Cap Year that, at the time of allocation, is protected
for lack of skill. In the event that, at the time of
allocation, none of the Base Compensation provided
for during the then-current and any remaining Salary
Cap Years under the original term of the Contract or
during the extended term is protected for lack of skill,
then the entire amount of the signing bonus shall be
allocated to the Salary Cap Year during which the
Extension is signed; and
(B) The Extension shall be deemed a Renegotiation and
shall be subject to the rules governing Renegotiations
set forth in Section 7 below.
(c) Loans to Players. The following rules shall apply to any loan
made by any Team to a player:
(1) If any such loan bears no interest (or annual interest at an
effective rate lower than the "Target Rate" (as defined below)),
then the interest shall be imputed on the outstanding balance at a
rate equal to the difference between the Target Rate and the actual
rate of interest to be paid by the player and such imputed interest
shall be included in the player's Salary. The "Target Rate" means
the "Prime Rate" (as defined below) plus one percent (1%) as of
the date the loan is agreed upon, except that the "Target Rate"
shall be no lower than seven percent (7%) or greater than nine
percent (9%). For purposes of this Section 3(c)(1), "Prime Rate"
means the prime rate reported in the "Money Rates" column or
any successor column of the Wall Street Journal.
(2) No loan made to a player may (along with other outstanding
loans to the player) exceed the amount of the player's Salary for
the then-current Salary Cap Year that is protected for lack of skill.
All loans must be repaid through deductions from the player's
remaining Current Base Compensation over the years of the
Contract that, at the time the loan is agreed upon, provide for
Base Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill (prior
to the Effective Season of any ETO) in equal annual amounts (the
"annual allocable repayment amounts"). If a loan is made at atime when the remaining Current Base Compensation due for the
relevant Season that is fully protected for lack of skill is less than
the annual allocable repayment amount that would be owed on a
loan for the full amount of the player's Current Base
Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill for the
relevant Season (the "maximum annual allocable repayment
amount"), the maximum loan amount for that Season shall be
reduced by the amount by which the maximum annual allocable
repayment amount exceeds the amount of remaining Current
Base Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill. (For
example, if a Player has \$1 million in Current Base Compensation
(fully protected for lack of skill) in the first Season of a five-year
Contract, and a loan is made during that Season at a time when
the Player has already received his Current Base Compensation
for that Season, the loan may not exceed \$800,000.)
(3) In addition to the restrictions set forth in Section 3(c)(2)
above: (i) no loan may be made that would result in a violation of
Article II, Section 12(e); and (ii) no loan may be made to a player
whose Contract provides for Base Compensation equal to the
Minimum Player Salary.
(4) Any forgiveness by a Team of a loan to a player shall be
deemed a Renegotiation in the Salary Cap Year of such
forgiveness and shall be subject to the rules governing
Renegotiations set forth in Section 7 below.
(d) Incentive Compensation.
(1) For purposes of determining a player's Salary each Salary Cap
Year, except as provided in Sections 3(d)(2)-(4) below, any
Performance Bonus (provided such Performance Bonus may be
included in a Player Contract in accordance with Section 5(d)
below), shall be included in Salary only if such Performance
Bonus would be earned if the Team's or player's performance
were identical to the performance in the immediately preceding
Salary Cap Year.
(2) Notwithstanding Section 3(d)(1) above, in the event that, at
the time of the signing of a Contract, Renegotiation or Extension,
the NBA or the Players Association believes that the performanceof a player and/or his Team during the immediately preceding
Salary Cap Year does not fairly predict the likelihood of the player
earning a Performance Bonus during any Salary Cap Year covered
by the Contract, Renegotiation or extended term of the Extension
(as the case may be), the NBA or the Players Association may
request that a jointly selected basketball expert ("Expert")
determine whether (i) in the case of an NBA challenge, it is very
likely that the bonus will be earned, or (ii) in the case of a Players
Association challenge, it is very likely that the bonus will not be
earned. The party initiating a proceeding before the Expert shall
carry the burden of proof. The Expert shall conduct a hearing
within five (5) business days after the initiation of the proceeding,
and shall render a determination within five (5) business days after
the hearing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 3(d)(2), no party may, in connection with any proceeding
before the Expert, refer to the facts that, absent a challenge
pursuant to this Section 3(d)(2), a Performance Bonus would or
would not be included in a player's Salary pursuant to Section
3(d)(1) above, or would be termed "Likely" or "Unlikely"
pursuant to Article I, Section 1(dd) or (sss). If, following an NBA
challenge, the Expert determines that a Performance Bonus is
very likely to be earned, the bonus shall be included in the player's
Salary. If, following a Players Association challenge, the Expert
determines that a Performance Bonus is very likely not to be
earned, the bonus shall be excluded from the player's Salary. The
Expert's determination that a Performance Bonus is very likely to
be earned or very likely not to be earned shall be final, binding
and unappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection
with any proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 3(d)(2) shall
be borne equally by the parties.
(3) In the case of a Rookie or a Veteran who did not play during
the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year who signs a Contract
containing a Performance Bonus, or in the case of a player signed
or acquired by an Expansion Team whose Contract contains a
Performance Bonus to be paid as a result of, in whole or in part,
the player's achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to
the Team's performance during its first Salary Cap Year, such
Performance Bonus will be included in Salary if it is likely to be
earned. In the event that the NBA and the Players Associationcannot agree as to whether a Performance Bonus is likely to be
earned, such dispute will be referred to the Expert, who will
determine whether the bonus is likely to be earned or not likely to
be earned. The Expert shall conduct a hearing within five (5)
business days after the initiation of the proceeding, and shall
render a determination within five (5) business days after the
hearing. The Expert's determination that a Performance Bonus is
likely to be earned or not likely to be earned shall be final, binding
and unappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection
with any proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 3(d)(3) shall
be borne equally by the parties.
(4) In the event that either party initiates a proceeding pursuant
to Section 3(d)(2) or (3) above, the player's Salary plus the full
amount of any disputed bonuses shall be included in Team Salary
during the pendency of the proceeding.
(5) In the event the NBA and the Players Association cannot
agree on an Expert, any challenge pursuant to Section 3(d)(2) and
(3) above may be filed with the Grievance Arbitrator in
accordance with Article XXXI, Sections 2-7 and 15.
(6) All Incentive Compensation described in Article II, Sections
3(b)(iii) and 3(c) shall be included in Salary.
(e) International Player Payments.
(1) Any amount in excess of the amounts set forth below
("Excluded International Player Payment Amounts") paid or to be
paid by or at the direction of any NBA Team to (i) any basketball
team other than an NBA Team, or (ii) any other entity,
organization, representative or person, for the purpose of
inducing a player who is participating in the game of basketball as
a professional outside of the United States to enter into a Player
Contract or in connection with securing the right to enter into a
Player Contract with such a player shall be deemed Salary (in the
form of a signing bonus) to the player:Excluded International Player
Salary Cap Year Payment Amount
2011-12 \$525,000
2012-13 \$550,000
2013-14 \$575,000
2014-15 \$600,000
2015-16 \$625,000
2016-17 \$650,000
2017-18 \$675,000
2018-19 \$700,000
2019-20 \$725,000
2020-21 \$750,000
(2) Subject to Article XIII, any payment up to the Excluded
International Player Payment Amount for a Salary Cap Year paid
by or at the direction of any NBA Team pursuant to Section
3(e)(1) above to a professional basketball team outside the United
States to secure the contractual release of a player shall not be
deemed Salary to the player.
(3) The Excluded International Player Payment Amount may be
paid in a single installment or in multiple installments. The
Excluded International Player Payment Amount, whether used in
whole or in part, may be used by an NBA Team whenever it signs
a player to a new Player Contract, except that the Excluded
International Player Payment Amount may not be used, in whole
or in part, more than once in any three-Season period with respect
to the same player.
(4) The Excluded International Player Payment Amount, or any
part of it, shall be deemed to have been used as of the date of the
Player Contract to which it applies, regardless of when it is
actually paid. A schedule of payments relating to the Excluded
International Player Payment Amount, or any part of it, agreed
upon at the time of the signing of the Player Contract to which it
applies, shall not be deemed a multiple use of the Excluded
International Player Payment Amount.
(5) Notwithstanding Section 3(e)(1) above, no amount paid or to
be paid pursuant to this Section 3(e) shall be counted toward theMinimum Team Salary obligation of a Team in accordance with
Section 2(b) or (c) above.
(6) Within two (2) business days following the NBA's receipt of
notice of any payments made by any NBA Team that are
governed by this Section 3(e), the NBA shall provide the Players
Association with written notice of such payments.
(f) One-Year Minimum Contracts. Except where otherwise stated
in this Agreement, the Salary of every player who signs a one-year, 10-Day
or Rest-of-Season Contract for the Minimum Player Salary applicable to
such player shall be the lesser of (1) such Minimum Player Salary, or (2) the
portion of such Minimum Player Salary that is not reimbursed out of the
League-wide benefits fund described in Article IV, Section 6(k)(2).
(g) Insurance Premium Reimbursement. If a Team reimburses a
player for life insurance premiums pursuant to Article II, Section 4(j)(ii),
such premium reimbursement shall not be included in the computation of
the player's Salary.
(h) Averaging. In accordance with Article XI, Section 5(c)(iii), a
player's Salary for each Salary Cap Year covered by his Contract shall be
deemed in certain circumstances to be the average of the aggregate Salaries
for each such Salary Cap Year.
(i) Existing Contracts. A player's Salary with respect to any Salary
Cap Year covered by a Contract entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement shall continue to be calculated in accordance with the Salary
Cap rules that were in existence at the time the Contract was entered into.
In no event shall the preceding sentence apply to the calculation of Salary
with respect to any Contract, Extension, Renegotiation, transaction, or
event entered into or occurring on or after the date of this Agreement.
Section 4. Determination of Team Salary.
(a) Computation. For purposes of computing Team Salary under
this Agreement, all of the following amounts shall be included:
(1) Subject to the rules set forth in this Article VII (including,
without limitation, the amnesty rules set forth in Section 12(f)(5)
and 12(j) below), the aggregate Salaries of all active players (andformer players to the extent provided by the terms of this
Agreement) attributable to a particular Salary Cap Year, including,
without limitation:
(i) Salaries paid or to be paid to players whose Player Contracts
have been terminated pursuant to the NBA's waiver
procedure (without regard to any revised payment schedule
that might be provided for in the terminated Player
Contracts), except that, with respect to any Player Contract
entered into or extended after the date of this Agreement
that has been terminated pursuant to the NBA's waiver
procedure, if the waiving Team elects in writing to have the
player's Salary stretched in accordance with Section 7(d)(5)
below, then the amount to be included in Team Salary for a
Salary Cap Year in respect of the terminated Player Contract
shall equal the "Stretched Salary Amounts" as calculated in
accordance with Section 7(d)(5) below.
(ii) Any amount called for in a retired player's Player Contract
paid or to be paid to the player. When a player retires and
the Team continues to pay such amounts, then, for
purposes of computing the player's Salary for the then-
current and any remaining Salary Cap Year covered by the
Contract, the aggregate of such amounts, notwithstanding
the payment schedule, shall be allocated pro rata over the
then-current and each remaining Salary Cap Year on the
basis of the remaining unearned protected Compensation in
each such Salary Cap Year at the time of retirement.
(iii) Amounts paid or to be paid pursuant to awards for, or
settlements of, grievances between a player and a Team
concerning Compensation obligations under a Player
Contract in accordance with the following rules (which,
except for purposes of Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(D) below, shall be
applied with respect to each Season for which there is any
Compensation in dispute, as if the grievance relates only to
such Season):
(A) (1) When a player initiates a Grievance (as defined in
Article XXXI) against a Team seeking the
payment of Compensation for a Season coveredby the current or any future Salary Cap Year that
the Team asserts is not owed, fifty percent (50%)
of the disputed amount shall be included in Team
Salary for the Salary Cap Year to which the
grievance relates. If the Grievance is resolved
during or prior to the Salary Cap Year to which it
relates, following resolution of the Grievance,
whether by award or settlement, the disputed
amount payable by the Team in excess of the fifty
percent (50%) allocation shall be included in
Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year to which the
Grievance relates, or, alternatively, the amount by
which the fifty percent (50%) allocation exceeds
the disputed amount payable by the Team shall
be subtracted from Team Salary for the Salary
Cap Year to which the Grievance relates.
(2) If a Grievance described in the first sentence of
Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(1) above is resolved after
the conclusion of the Salary Cap Year to which it
relates, the disputed amount payable by the Team
related to such Salary Cap Year in excess of the
fifty percent (50%) allocation shall be included in
Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which the
Grievance is resolved, or, alternatively, the
amount by which the fifty percent (50%)
allocation exceeds the disputed amount payable
by the Team related to such Salary Cap Year shall
be subtracted from Team Salary for the Salary
Cap Year in which the grievance is resolved.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Team
shall be required to pay additional tax to the NBA
if and to the extent that, due to the operation of
this Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(2), the aggregate tax it
pays to the NBA pursuant to Section 12(f) below
for the two (2) Salary Cap Years in question (the
Salary Cap Year for which the fifty percent (50%)
allocation was made and the subsequent Salary
Cap Year in which the Grievance was resolved) is
less than it would have been had the Grievancebeen resolved during the Salary Cap Year to
which it related; a Team shall be entitled to a tax
refund from the NBA if and to the extent that,
due to the operation of this Section
4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(2), the aggregate tax it pays to the
NBA pursuant to Section 12(f) below for the two
(2) Salary Cap Years in question is greater than it
would have been had the grievance been resolved
during the Salary Cap Year to which it related. In
order to facilitate any such required tax refund
from the NBA to the Team, the NBA shall set
aside, pending resolution of the Grievance, the
amount of tax paid by that Team in the Salary
Cap Year to which the Grievance relates that is
attributable to the fifty percent (50%) allocation.
Following resolution of the Grievance, the NBA
shall pay to the Team the tax refund to which it is
entitled (if any) based upon the resolution of the
Grievance, and the remainder of the set aside tax
funds shall be distributed by the NBA to one (1)
or more Teams or otherwise used by the League
in such manner as the NBA may reasonably
determine, consistent with the provisions of
Section 12(g) below.
(B) When a player initiates a Grievance against a Team
seeking the payment of Compensation for a Season
covered by a prior Salary Cap Year that the Team
asserts is not owed, following resolution of the
Grievance, whether by award or settlement, the
disputed amount payable by the Team, if any, shall be
included in Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year in
which the Grievance is resolved (but only to the
extent that it had been previously excluded from Team
Salary). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a
Team shall be required to pay additional tax to the
NBA if and to the extent that, due to the operation of
this Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(B), the aggregate tax it pays to
the NBA pursuant to Section 12(f) below for the two
(2) Salary Cap Years in question (the Salary Cap Yearto which the Grievance related and the subsequent
Salary Cap Year in which the Grievance was resolved)
is less than it would have been had the disputed
amount payable by the Team been included in Team
Salary during the Salary Cap Year to which it related; a
Team shall be entitled to a tax refund from the NBA if
and to the extent that, due to the operation of this
Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(B), the aggregate tax it pays to the
NBA pursuant to Section 12(f) below for the two (2)
Salary Cap Years in question is greater than it would
have been had the disputed amount payable by the
Team been included in Team Salary during the Salary
Cap Year to which it related. In order to facilitate any
such required tax refund from the NBA to the Team,
the NBA shall set aside, pending resolution of the
Grievance, the amount of tax paid by that Team in the
Salary Cap Year to which the Grievance relates that is
attributable to the fifty percent (50%) allocation.
Following resolution of the Grievance, the NBA shall
pay to the Team the tax refund to which it is entitled
(if any) based upon the resolution of the Grievance,
and the remainder of the set aside tax funds shall be
distributed by the NBA to one (1) or more Teams or
otherwise used by the League in such manner as the
NBA may reasonably determine, consistent with the
provisions of Section 12(g) below.
(C) If a Grievance relates to a player's Compensation for
more than one (1) Season, for purposes of
determining the disputed amount payable by the Team
with respect to each such Season following the
resolution of the Grievance, the aggregate amounts
payable to the player for all Seasons pursuant to the
resolution of the grievance, whether by award or
settlement, shall be allocated to each such Season in
proportion to the amount of Compensation that was
in dispute for such Season, unless, in the case of an
award, the Grievance Arbitrator allocates the amounts
payable to the player to specific Seasons.(D) Immediately upon reaching any agreement (oral or
written) to resolve a Grievance relating to a player's
Compensation, a Team shall notify the NBA by
facsimile or email and provide the NBA with the
terms of such agreement. A Team's failure to comply
with the preceding sentence may be considered
evidence of a violation of Article XIII. If a Team
delays or attempts to delay in any manner the
processing or resolution of a Grievance relating to a
player's Compensation for the purpose of creating or
increasing its Room in any Salary Cap Year or for the
purpose of reducing or deferring a tax payment to the
NBA, such conduct shall constitute a violation of
Article XIII.
(iv) Salaries anticipated to be included in Team Salary based
upon any agreement disclosed to the NBA pursuant to
Article II, Section 12(a)(i) (including, without limitation, any
executed Player Contract whose validity is conditional on
the passage of a physical examination by the player or on
the assignment of the Contract), except to the extent that
any such Salary is less than a player's Free Agent Amount
(as defined in Section 4(d) below).
(2) (i) With respect to each Veteran Free Agent who last played for
a Team who is an Unrestricted Free Agent, the Free Agent
Amount (as defined in Section 4(d) below) attributable to
such Veteran Free Agent.
(ii) With respect to each Veteran Free Agent who last played for
a Team who is a Restricted Free Agent, the greater of
(A) the Free Agent Amount (as defined in Section 4(d)
below) attributable to such Veteran Free Agent, (B) the
Salary called for in any outstanding Qualifying Offer

Minimum Annual Salary applicable to such player that would not
be reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits fund described in
Article IV, Section 6(k).
(6) For purposes of this Section 4(d) only, a player's "prior
Salary" means his Regular Salary for the prior Season plus any
signing bonus allocation and the amount of any Incentive
Compensation actually earned for such Season.
(e) First Round Picks.
(1) A First Round Pick, immediately upon selection in the Draft,
shall be included in the Team Salary of the Team that holds his
draft rights at one hundred percent (100%) of his applicable
Rookie Scale Amount, and, subject to Section 4(e)(2) and (3)
below, shall continue to be included in the Team Salary of any
Team that holds his draft rights (including any Team to which the
player's draft rights are assigned) until such time as the player
signs with such Team or until the Team loses or assigns its
exclusive draft rights to the player.
(2) In the event that a First Round Pick signs with a non-NBA
team, the player's applicable Rookie Scale Amount shall be
excluded from the Team Salary of the Team that holds his draft
rights, beginning on the date he signs such non-NBA contract or
the first day of the Regular Season, whichever is later, and shall be
included again in his Team's Team Salary at the applicable Rookie
Scale Amount on the following July 1 or the date the player's
contract ends (or the player is released from his non-NBA
contractual obligations), whichever is earlier, unless the Team
renounces its exclusive rights to the player in accordance with
Article X, Section 4(f). If, after such following July 1, or any
subsequent July 1, the player signs another, or remains under,
contract with a non-NBA team, the player's applicable Rookie
Scale Amount will again be excluded from Team Salary beginning
on the date of the contract signing or the first day of the Regular
Season commencing after such July 1, whichever is later, and will
again be included in Team Salary at the applicable Rookie Scale
Amount on the following July 1 or the date the player's contract
ends (or the player is released from his non-NBA contractualobligations), whichever is earlier, unless the Team renounces its
exclusive rights to the player in accordance with Article X,
Section 4(f).
(3) A Team that holds draft rights to a First Round Pick may
elect to have the player's applicable Rookie Scale Amount
excluded from its Team Salary at any time prior to the first day of
any Regular Season by providing the NBA with a written
statement that the Team will not sign the player during that Salary
Cap Year accompanied by a written statement from the First
Round Pick renouncing his right to accept any outstanding
Required Tender made to him by the Team. After making such
an election, (i) the Team shall be prohibited from signing the
player during that Salary Cap Year, except in accordance with
Section 5(e)(4)(ii) below, (ii) the Team shall continue to possess
such rights with respect to the player that the Team possessed
pursuant to Article X immediately prior to such election, and
(iii) the player's applicable Rookie Scale Amount shall be included
again in his Team's Team Salary at the applicable Rookie Scale
Amount on the following July 1. When a First Round Pick
provides a Team with a written statement renouncing his right to
accept that year's outstanding Required Tender, the Player shall
no longer be permitted to accept it.
(4) For purposes of this Section 4(e), in the event that a First
Round Pick does not sign a Contract with the Team that holds his
draft rights during the Salary Cap Year immediately following the
Draft in which he was selected (or during the same Salary Cap
Year in which he was drafted if the Draft occurs on or after July
1), the "applicable Rookie Scale Amount" for such First Round
Pick means, with respect to any subsequent Salary Cap Year, the
Rookie Scale Amount that would apply if the player were drafted
in the Draft immediately preceding such Salary Cap Year at the
same draft position at which he was actually selected.
(f) Incomplete Rosters.
(1) If at any time from July 1 through the day prior to the first
day of the Regular Season a Team has fewer than twelve (12)
players, determined in accordance with Section 4(f)(2) below,included in its Team Salary, then the Team's Team Salary shall be
increased by an amount calculated as follows:
STEP 1: Subtract from twelve (12) the number of players
included in Team Salary.
STEP 2: If the result in Step 1 is a positive number, multiply the
result in Step 1 by the Minimum Annual Salary
applicable to players with zero (0) Years of Service for
that Salary Cap Year.
(2) In determining whether a Team has fewer than twelve (12)
players included in its Team Salary for purposes of Section 4(f)(1)
above only, the only players who shall be counted are (i) players
under Contract with the Team who are included in Team Salary,
(ii) Free Agents who are included in Team Salary pursuant to
Section 4 (a)(2) above, (iii) players to whom Offer Sheets have
been given, and (iv) unsigned First Round Picks who are included
in Team Salary pursuant to Section 4(e) above.
(g) Renouncing.
(1) To renounce a Veteran Free Agent, a Team must provide the
NBA with a written statement renouncing its right to re-sign the
player, effective no earlier than the July 1 following the last Season
covered by the player's Contract. (The NBA shall notify the
Players Association of any such renunciation by fax or email
within two (2) business days following receipt of notice of such
renunciation.) If a Team renounces a Veteran Free Agent, the
player will no longer qualify as a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent,
Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran
Free Agent, as the case may be, and the Team will only be
permitted to re-sign such player with Room (i.e., the Team cannot
sign such player pursuant to Section 6(b) below) or pursuant to
the Minimum Player Salary Exception. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event a Team renounces one or more players in
order to create Room for an Offer Sheet, and the offeree-player's
Prior Team subsequently matches the Offer Sheet and enters into
a Contract with that player, the Team may rescind the
renunciation(s) within two (2) business days of the date the Offer
Sheet is matched, whereupon any such "unrenounced" player mayagain sign a Player Contract with the Team as a First Round Pick,
Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early Qualifying Veteran Free
Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, as the case may
be, and will again be included in his Prior Team's Team Salary at
his applicable Free Agent Amount; provided, however, that a
Team may not rescind the renunciation of a player if (i) at the
time the player was renounced the Team's Team Salary was at or
below the Salary Cap and "unrenouncing" the player would cause
the Team's Team Salary to exceed the Salary Cap, or (ii) at the
time the player was renounced the Team's Team Salary was above
the Salary Cap and "unrenouncing" the player would cause the
Team's Team Salary to exceed the Salary Cap by more than the
amount by which the Team's Team Salary exceeded the Salary
Cap prior to the renunciation.
(2) A Team cannot renounce any player to whom the Team has
made a Qualifying Offer until such time as the Qualifying Offer is
no longer in effect.
(h) Long-Term Injuries. Any player who suffers a career-ending
injury or illness, and whose contract is terminated by the Team in
accordance with the NBA waiver procedure, will be excluded from his
Team's Team Salary as follows:
(1) Subject to Section 4(h)(5) below, beginning on the first
anniversary of the date of the last NBA Regular Season or playoff
game in which the player played, the Team may apply to the NBA
to have the player's Salary for each remaining Salary Cap Year
covered by the Contract excluded from Team Salary (i) if the
player played in ten (10) or more NBA Regular Season and
playoff games in a Season, on the first anniversary of the date
during such Season in which the player last played in a NBA
Regular Season or playoff game, (ii) if the player played in less
than ten (10) NBA Regular Season and playoff games in a Season,
on the later of (A) sixty (60) days following the date during such
Season in which the player last played in a NBA Regular Season
or playoff game, and (B) the first anniversary of the date during a
prior NBA Season in which the player last played in a NBA
Regular Season or playoff game.(2) The determination of whether a player has suffered a career-
ending injury or illness shall be made by a physician selected
jointly by the NBA and the Players Association. A player shall be
deemed to have suffered a career-ending injury or illness if it is
determined that the player has an injury or illness that (i) prevents
him from playing skilled professional basketball at an NBA level
for the duration of his career, or (ii) substantially impairs his
ability to play skilled professional basketball at an NBA level and
is of such severity that continuing to play professional basketball
at an NBA level would subject the player to medically
unacceptable risk of suffering a life-threatening or permanently
disabling injury or illness.
(3) Notwithstanding Section 4(h)(1) and (2) above, if after a
player's Salary is excluded from Team Salary in accordance with
this Section 4(h), the player plays in twenty-five (25) NBA Regular
Season and playoff games in any Season for any Team, the
excluded Salary for the Salary Cap Year covering such Season and
each subsequent Salary Cap Year shall thereupon be included in
Team Salary of the Team from which the Salary was previously
excluded (and if the twenty-fifth game played is a playoff game,
then the excluded Salary shall be included in Team Salary
retroactively as of the start of the Team's last Regular Season
game). After a player's Salary for one (1) or more Salary Cap
Years has been included in Team Salary in accordance with this
Section 4(h)(3), the Team shall be permitted to re-apply to have
the player's Salary (for each Salary Cap Year remaining at the time
of the re-application) excluded from Team Salary in accordance
with the rules set forth in this Section 4(h) (including the waiting
period criteria set forth in Section 4(h)(1) above).
(4) If a Team applies to have a player's Salary excluded from its
Team Salary pursuant to this Section 4(h), the player shall
cooperate in the processing of the application, including by
appearing at the reasonably scheduled place and time for
examination by the jointly-selected physician. The player shall not
make any misrepresentation or fail to disclose any relevant
information in connection with the processing of the application.
(5) Only the Team with which the player was under Contract at
the time his career-ending injury or illness became known orreasonably should have become known shall be permitted to
apply to have the player's Salary excluded from Team Salary
pursuant to this Section 4(h).
(6) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
(i) if a Team applies to have a player's Salary excluded from its
Team Salary pursuant to this Section 4(h) and such application is
granted, the Team will be prohibited from re-signing or re-
acquiring that player at any time, and (ii) if a Team makes a
request for an Exception to replace a Disabled Player pursuant to
Section 6(c) below for a Salary Cap Year, then, whether such
application is granted or denied, the Team will be precluded from
applying to have that player's Salary excluded from its Team
Salary pursuant to this Section 4(h) for the same Salary Cap Year.
(i) Summer Contracts.
(1) Except as provided in Section 4(i)(2) below and subject to
Article II, Section 14, from July 1 until the day prior to the first
day of the next Regular Season, a Team may enter into Player
Contracts that will not be included in Team Salary until the first
day of such Regular Season (i.e., the player will be deemed not to
have any Salary until the first day of such Regular Season),
provided that such Contracts satisfy the requirements of this
Section 4(i) (a "Summer Contract"). Except as set forth in the
following sentence, no Summer Contract may provide for
(i) Compensation of any kind that is or may be paid or earned
prior to the first day of the next Regular Season, or
(ii) Compensation protection of any kind pursuant to Article II,
Section 3(e) or 4. The only consideration that may be provided to
a player signed to a Summer Contract, prior to the start of the
Regular Season, is per diem, lodging, transportation,
compensation in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of the Uniform
Player Contract, and a disability insurance policy covering
disabilities incurred while such player participates in summer
leagues or rookie camps for the Team. A Team that has entered
into one or more Summer Contracts must terminate such
Contracts no later than the day prior to the first day of a Regular
Season, except to the extent the Team has Room for such
Contracts.(2) A Team may not enter into a Summer Contract with a
Veteran Free Agent who last played for the Team unless the
Contract is for one (1) Season only and provides for no more than
the Minimum Player Salary applicable to such player.
(j) Team Salary Summaries.
(1) The NBA shall provide the Players Association with Team
Salary summaries and a list of current Exceptions twice a month
during the Regular Season and once every week during the off-
season.
(2) In the event that the NBA fails to provide the Players
Association with any Team Salary summary or list of Exceptions
as provided for in Section 4(j)(1) above, the Players Association
shall notify the NBA of such failure, and the NBA, upon receipt
of such notice, shall as soon as reasonably possible, but in no
event later than two (2) business days following receipt of such
notice, provide the Players Association with any such summary or
list that should have been provided pursuant to Section 4(j)(1)
above.
Section 5. Operation of Salary Cap.
(a) Basic Rule. A Team's Team Salary may not exceed the Salary Cap
at any time unless the Team is using one of the Exceptions set forth in

(b) Room. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,

Salary for such Salary Cap Year.(2) No Player Contract may provide for any Unlikely Bonus for
the first Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract that, if included
in the player's Salary for such Salary Cap Year, would result in the
Team's Team Salary exceeding the Room under which it is signing
the Contract. For the sole purpose of determining whether a
Team has Room for a new Unlikely Bonus, the Team's Room
shall be deemed reduced by all Unlikely Bonuses in Contracts
approved by the Commissioner that may be paid to all of the

the matter to a neutral physician (to be selected by the parties at
the commencement of each Salary Cap Year) to review the
relevant medical information and, if the neutral physician deems it
appropriate, examine the player. Within three (3) business days of
receipt of such information (and examination of the player, ifrequested), the neutral physician shall make a final determination,
which will be final, binding and unappealable. The cost of the
NBA physician will be borne by the NBA. The cost of the
neutral physician will be borne equally and jointly by the NBA and
the Players Association.
(5) If a Team requests an Exception pursuant to this Section
6(c), the player with respect to whom the request is made shall
cooperate in the processing of the request, including by appearing
at the scheduled place and time for examination by the NBA-
appointed physician and, if necessary, the neutral physician. The
player shall not make any misrepresentation or fail to disclose any
relevant information in connection with the processing of the
application.
(6) Notwithstanding a Team's receipt of an Exception in respect
of a Disabled Player pursuant to this Section 6(c), such player,
upon recovering from his injury or illness, may resume playing for
the Team. If the player resumes playing for the Team, or is
traded, prior to the Team's use of its Exception, the Exception
shall be extinguished.
(7) The Disabled Player Exception is available only to the Team
with which the player was under Contract at the time his
Disabling Injury or Illness became known or reasonably should
have become known.
(8) If a Team makes a request for an Exception to replace a
Disabled Player pursuant to this Section 6(c) and such request is
denied, the Team shall not be permitted to make any subsequent
request for an Exception to replace the same player pursuant to
this Section 6(c) unless ninety (90) days have passed since the first
request was denied and the Team establishes that the subsequent
request is based on a new injury or an aggravation of the same
injury. If a Team makes a request for an Exception to replace a
Disabled Player for a Season pursuant to this Section 6(c), then,
whether such request is granted or denied, the Team shall be
permitted to renew its request for an Exception to replace the
Disabled Player for a subsequent Season(s) by applying for
another Exception in respect of that player for such Season in
accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 6(c).(d) Bi-annual Exception. Subject to the rules set forth in Section

Contract or, in the case of an Extension, the last Season of the
original term of the Contract, or (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the

above the Salary Cap. If, in accordance with the preceding sentence, a
Team and a player enter into a Player Contract and such Contract covers
more than one (1) Season, annual increases and decreases in Salary and

more than one (1) Exception available at the same time, the Team shall
have the right to choose which Exception it wishes to use to sign or
acquire a player.(m) Other Rules.

Exception, Bi-annual Exception, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary
Exception, Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception and Traded
Player Exception set forth in Section 6(c), (d), (e), (f) and (j)
above, respectively, except as set forth in Section 6(j)(2) and (3)
above, only if, at the time any such Exception would arise and at
all times until it is used, the Team's Team Salary, excluding the
amount(s) of such Exception and any other Exception that would
be included in Team Salary pursuant to Section 6(m)(2) below, is
(i) at or above the Salary Cap, or (ii) below the Salary Cap by less
than the amount(s) of the Team's Exception(s) (excluding the
amount of the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception unless the
Team is no longer able to use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary
Exception but remains able to use the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary
Exception, in which case the amount of the Taxpayer Mid-Level
Salary Exception shall be included).
(2) In the event that when a Disabled Player Exception, Bi-
annual Exception, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception (or
the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception instead of the Non-
Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception if the Team is no longer
able to use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception but
remains able to use the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception)
and/or Traded Player Exception arises, the Team's Team Salary is
below the Salary Cap (or in the event that, prior to the expiration
of any such Exceptions, the Team's Team Salary falls below the
Salary Cap) by less than the amount of such Exceptions, then
(i) the Team's Team Salary shall include, until the Exceptions are
actually used or until the Team no longer is entitled to use the
Exceptions, the amount of the Exceptions (or any unused portion
of the Exceptions), and (ii) the amount by which the Team's
Team Salary is less than the Salary Cap shall thereby be
extinguished. When the Disabled Player Exception is used to sign
or acquire a player, the Replacement Player's Salary for the Season
covered by his Contract, instead of the amount of the Exception,
shall be included in Team Salary. When a Bi-annual Exception,
Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception or Taxpayer Mid-
Level Salary Exception is used to sign a player, or when a TradedPlayer Exception is used to acquire a player, the Salary for the first
Season of the signed or acquired Contract plus any then-unused
portion of the Exception, instead of the full amount of the
Exception, shall be included in Team Salary. A Team may at any
time renounce its rights to use an Exception, in which case the
Exception (or any unused portion of the Exception) will no
longer be included in Team Salary.
(3) For purposes of Section 6(d), Section 6(e), Section 6(f) and
Section 8(e) below, a Team's Team Salary for any Salary Cap Year
shall be adjusted as follows:

extended on or after the date of this Agreement (but
in the case of Extensions, only with respect to the
extended term), Team Salary shall include all
Performance Bonuses excluded from a player's Salary
under Section 3(d) above;
(B) Team Salary shall include the Salary attributable to a
Contract signed by a Free Agent with zero (0) Years of
Service or one (1) Year of Service provided for in
Section 12(f)(2) below;
(C) Team Salary shall include any amount that could be
added to the Team's Team Salary for such Salary Cap
Year pursuant to Section 4(a)(1)(iii) above;
(D) Team Salary shall exclude Free Agent Amounts as
described in Section 4(a)(2); provided, however, that
with respect to any Restricted Free Agent, Team
Salary shall include the greater of (i) the Salary plus
Unlikely Bonuses called for in any outstanding
Qualifying Offer tendered to the player, or (ii) the
Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses called for in any First
Refusal Exercise Notice (as defined in Article XI,
Section 5(e)) issued with respect to such player;
(E) Team Salary shall exclude amounts with respect to
unsigned First Round Picks described in Section
4(a)(4) above, and shall include the amount of anyoutstanding Required Tender to a First Round Pick or
Second Round Pick; and
(F) Team Salary shall exclude the amount of any Salary
Cap Exception that is deemed included in Team Salary
pursuant to Sections 4(a)(7) and 6(m)(2) above.
(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
if a player is a Veteran Free Agent whose last Contract was a
Rookie Scale Contract and whose Prior Team did not exercise the
first Option Year to extend such Contract for a third Season or
whose Prior Team did not exercise its second Option Year to
extend such Contract for a fourth Season, then any new Player
Contract that the player and Team with whom the player was
under his Rookie Scale Contract enter into may provide for
Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses in the first
Salary Cap Year of up to the Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses and
Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, that the player would have
received for such Salary Cap Year had his Prior Team exercised its
first or second Option Year (as applicable). Annual increases and
decreases in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by
Section 5(c)(2) above.
(5) Beginning on January 10 of each Season, each unused
Exception, other than the Traded Player Exception, the Minimum
Player Salary Exception (which is governed by Section 6(i) above
and Article I, Section (ii)) and the Disabled Player Exception, shall
be reduced daily throughout the end of the Regular Season by the
product of the amount of the unused Exception as of January 10
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1) and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Regular
Season.

be governed by Section 5(c)(5) above.
(4) Notwithstanding Section 7(a)(3) above and subject to
Article II, Section 7, any Player Contract of a player who has
played for his current Team for at least ten (10) Seasons and
whose Salary in the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original
term of the Contract is less than the Salary in the second-to-last
Salary Cap Year covered by such Contract may, in the first Salary
Cap Year covered by an extended term, provide for a Salary equal
to one hundred seven and one-half percent (107.5% of the
greater of (i) the average of the Regular Salaries for each Salary
Cap Year covered by the original Contract beginning with theSalary Cap Year in which such Contract was entered into, or
previously extended, as the case may be, or (ii) the Regular Salary
in the last Salary Cap Year covered by his original Contract. In
the event that the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original
term of the Contract provides for Incentive Compensation, the
first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term may provide
for Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses of up to one hundred
seven and one-half percent (107.5% of the Likely Bonuses and
Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, in the last Salary Cap Year covered
by the original term. Annual increases and decreases in Salary and
Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by Section 5(c)(3) above,
except that, for purposes of only clause (ii) of this Section 7(a)(4),
the phrase "Regular Salary" in Section 5(c)(3) above shall be
deemed to mean the greater of (A) the average of the Regular
Salaries for each Salary Cap Year covered by the original Contract
beginning with the Salary Cap Year in which such Contract was
entered into, or previously extended, as the case may be, or
(B) the Regular Salary in the last Salary Cap Year covered by the
original Contract.
(b) Rookie Scale Extensions. No Rookie Scale Contract may be
extended except in accordance with the following:
(1) A First Round Pick who enters into a Rookie Scale Contract
may enter into an Extension of such Rookie Scale Contract during
the period from the day following the last day of the Moratorium
Period through October 31 of the second Option Year provided
for in such Contract (assuming the Team exercises such Option).
(2) An Extension of a Rookie Scale Contract may provide for
Salary and Unlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year covered
by the extended term totaling no more than the maximum
amount provided for in Article II, Section 7. Annual increases
and decreases in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by
Section 5(c)(4) above.
(c) Renegotiations. No Player Contract may be renegotiated except
in accordance with the following:
(1) Subject to Section 7(c)(2) and (3) below, a Player Contract
covering a term of four (4) or more Seasons may be renegotiatedno sooner than the third anniversary of the signing of the
Contract.
(2) Subject to Section 7(c)(3) below, any Player Contract that has
been renegotiated in accordance with Section 7(c)(1) above to
provide for an increase in Salary or Incentive Compensation in
any Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract of more than four
and one-half percent (4.5%), or extended in accordance with
Section 7(a) or (b) above, may not subsequently be renegotiated
until the third anniversary of the signing of such Extension or
Renegotiation.
(3) Assuming Section 7(c) (1) or (2) above are satisfied, a Team
with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may renegotiate a Player
Contract in accordance with the following rules:
(i) Subject to Article II, Section 7, the Renegotiation may
provide for additional Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses
and/or Unlikely Bonuses for the then-current Salary Cap
Year covered by the Contract (the "Renegotiation Season")
that, in the aggregate, would not exceed the Team's Room at
the time of the Renegotiation.
(ii) Every category (Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses and Unlikely
Bonuses, respectively) that is increased for the
Renegotiation Season must also be increased for each of the
remaining Seasons of the Contract. For each Season of the
Contract after the Renegotiation Season, the player's
additional Regular Salary may increase or decrease over the
previous Season's additional Regular Salary by no more than
seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the additional Regular
Salary provided for in the Renegotiation Season. In the
event that the Renegotiation Season provides for additional
Incentive Compensation, the amount of additional Likely
Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses provided for in each Season
after the Renegotiation Season may increase or decrease by
up to seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the amount of
additional Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses,
respectively, provided for in the Renegotiation Season.(iii) No Renegotiation may contain a signing bonus, unless the
Renegotiation is accompanied by an Extension and the
signing bonus would otherwise be permitted under the rules
governing the inclusion of signing bonuses in Extensions.
(4) In no event may a Team with a Team Salary at or above the
Salary Cap renegotiate a Player Contract.
(5) In no event may a Team and a player renegotiate a Player
Contract from March 1 through June 30 of any Salary Cap Year.
(d) Other.
(1) In no event shall a Team and player negotiate a decrease in
Salary or in any Incentive Compensation for any Salary Cap Year
covered by a Player Contract.
(2) A Player Contract that is extended pursuant to Section 7(a)
above may be renegotiated simultaneously, but only if and to the
extent permitted by the rules set forth in Section 7(c) above.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a
Player Contract is extended pursuant to Section 7(a) above and
renegotiated simultaneously, then the amount of the player's
Salary, excluding Incentive Compensation, in the first Salary Cap
Year covered by the extended term may decrease by no more than
forty percent (40%) of the player's Regular Salary (as renegotiated)
in the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original term. In the
event that the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original term
provides for Incentive Compensation, the amount of Likely
Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year
covered by the extended term may decrease by up to forty percent
(40%) of the player's Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses,
respectively (as renegotiated), in the last Salary Cap Year covered
by the original term.
(3) For the sole purpose of enabling an assignee Team to acquire
a Player Contract by trade, the player and the assignor Team may
agree to waive all or any portion of a trade bonus, but only to the
extent necessary to make the trade permissible in accordance with
the rules set forth in Section 6(j) above. Thus, for example, a
trade will be considered permissible if the Team has a pre-existingTraded Player Exception that could be used to make the trade
work in accordance with the rules set forth in Section 6(j). In the
event that, in connection with a trade, a player's Contract is
amended in accordance with this Section 7(d)(3), such Contract
may not be subsequently extended or renegotiated until the later
of (i) six (6) months from the date of the trade, or (ii) the first date
on which the Contract could otherwise be extended or
renegotiated pursuant to this Section 7.
(4) In the event that a Team and a player agree to amend a
Player Contract in accordance with Article II, Section 3(l), then
for purposes of calculating the player's Salary for the then-current
and any remaining Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract,
notwithstanding any stretch or acceleration of the player's
protected Compensation payment schedule, the aggregate
reduction in the player's protected Compensation shall be
allocated pro rata over the then-current and each remaining Salary
Cap Year on the basis of the remaining unearned protected Base
Compensation in each such Salary Cap Year.
(5) In the event that a Team terminates a Player Contract that
was entered into or extended on or after the date of this
Agreement and the payment of the player's protected
Compensation for one or more Seasons is stretched in accordance
with Article II, Section 4(k), then the waiving Team may elect to
have the player's Salary for the then-current and any remaining
Salary Cap Years stretched (i.e., re-attributed) for purposes of
calculating the Team's Team Salary as follows ("Stretched Salary
Amounts"):
(A) in the event a request for waivers on the player is
made during the period from September 1 through the
following June 30, (i) the player's post-termination
Salary for the then-current Salary Cap Year (after
giving effect to the provisions of Section (d)(4) above,
if applicable) shall remain unchanged, and (ii) the
player's post-termination Salary for each remaining
Salary Cap Year (after giving effect to the provisions
of Section (d)(4) above, if applicable) shall be
aggregated and allocated evenly over a number of
Salary Cap Years equal to twice the number ofSeasons (including any Player Option Year) remaining
on the Contract following the Salary Cap Year in
which the request for waivers occurred (not including
the then-current Season or, in the case of requests for
waivers made from September 1 through the first day
of a Regular Season, the upcoming Season), plus one
(1) Season; or
(B) in the event a request for waivers on the player is
made during the period from July 1 through August
31, the player's post-termination Salary for the then-
current and any remaining Salary Cap Years (after
giving effect to the provisions of Section (d)(4) above,
if applicable) shall be aggregated and allocated evenly
over a number of Salary Cap Years equal to twice the
number of Seasons (including any Player Option Year)
remaining on the Contract following the date of the
request for waivers (including the upcoming Season),
plus one (1) Season;
With respect to Player Contracts extended on or after the date of
this Agreement, the foregoing Salary re-attribution shall apply
only with respect to the extended term of the Player Contract. To
make an election pursuant to this Section (d)(5), a Team must,
within one (1) business day following the termination of the
Contract, provide the NBA with a written statement electing to
stretch the player's Salary (and the NBA shall provide notice of
such election to the Players Association by facsimile or email
within two (2) business days). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, in no event shall a Team be permitted to elect to
stretch a waived player's Salary if the portion of the Team's Team
Salary representing all of the Team's waived players (and any
other former players) in any future Salary Cap Year exceeds or as
a result of the proposed stretch would exceed fifteen percent
(15%) of the Salary Cap in effect during the Salary Cap Year in
which the player is waived.
(6) In no event shall a Team and player amend a Contract for
the purpose of terminating or shortening the term of the
Contract, except in accordance with the NBA waiver procedure or
Article XII, Section 2.Section 8. Trade Rules.
(a) A Team shall not be permitted to pay or receive in connection with
one (1) or more trades occurring during a Salary Cap Year, directly or
indirectly, more than an aggregate of the amounts set forth below in cash
across all such trades, including cash received as reimbursement for
Compensation obligations to players whom the Team is acquiring.
Maximum Annual
Salary Cap Year Cash Limit
2011-12 \$3.0 million
2012-13 \$3.1 million
2013-14 \$3.2 million
2014-15 \$3.3 million
2015-16 \$3.4 million
2016-17 \$3.5 million
2017-18 \$3.6 million
2018-19 \$3.7 million
2019-20 \$3.8 million
2020-21 \$3.9 million
For purposes of this Section 8(a), (i) if a Contract is signed and then
traded pursuant to Section 8(e)(1) below, and the Contract contains a
signing bonus, the payment of all or any portion of such bonus by the
Team that signed the Contract shall be treated as a reimbursement of a
Compensation obligation of the assignee Team and shall be subject to this
Section 8(a), and (ii) the amounts paid or received by a Team in connection
with one (1) or more trades occurring during a Salary Cap Year shall not be
netted against each other (thus, for example, if Team A pays \$3 million in
connection with one (1) trade occurring during the 2011-12 Salary Cap
Year and receives \$3 million from another Team in connection with either
the same or a subsequent trade occurring during the same Salary Cap Year,
Team A would be unable to either pay or receive any cash in connection
with any subsequent trades that it makes during that Salary Cap Year).
(b) A player with a one-year Contract (excluding any Option Year)
who would be a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or an Early Qualifying
Veteran Free Agent upon completing the playing services called for under
his Contract cannot be traded without the player's consent. Should the
player consent and be traded, then, for purposes of determining whether
the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early Qualifying VeteranFree Agent or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent at the conclusion of the
Contract or any subsequent Contract between the player and the assignee
Team, the player shall be considered as having changed Teams by means
of signing a Contract with the assignee Team as a Free Agent (and not by
means of trade).
(c) A Team cannot trade any player after the NBA trade deadline
occurring in the last Season of the player's Contract, or after the NBA
trade deadline occurring in any Season that could be the last Season of the
player's Contract based upon the exercise or non-exercise of an Option or
Early Termination Option.
(d) (i) No Draft Rookie who signs a Player Contract may be
traded before thirty (30) days following the date on which
the Contract is signed.
(ii) No player who signs a Contract as a Free Agent may be
traded before the later of (A) three (3) months following
the date on which such Contract was signed or (B) the
December 15 of the Salary Cap Year in which such
Contract was signed; provided, that if a Contract is signed
in connection with an agreement to trade the Contract in
accordance with Section 8(e) below, the foregoing rule
shall not apply to the initial trade but shall instead be
applicable if the Contract is traded a second time.
(iii) Notwithstanding the rule set forth in Section (d)(ii) above,
any player who signs a Contract with his prior Team
meeting the following criteria may not be traded before the
later of (x) three (3) months following the date on which
such Contract was signed or (y) the January 15 of the Salary
Cap Year in which such Contract was signed: the Team
Salary of the player's Team is at or above the Salary Cap
and the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or Early
Qualifying Veteran Free Agent who, in accordance with
Section 6(b)(1) or (3) above, enters into a new Player
Contract with his prior Team that provides for a Salary for
the first Season of such new Contract greater than one
hundred twenty percent (120%) of the Salary for the last
Season of the player's immediately prior Contract. Therule set forth in this Section (d)(iii) shall not apply to a
player if his new Contract provides for Salary equal to the
Minimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind). For
purposes of the foregoing sentence, if the player's
immediately prior Contract was a one-year Contract that
provided for Salary equal to the Minimum Player Salary
(with no bonuses of any kind), the player's prior Salary
shall include the portion of the Minimum Player Salary, if
any, that was reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits
fund described in Article IV, Section 6(k).
(e) (1) A Veteran Free Agent and his Prior Team may enter into a
Player Contract pursuant to an agreement between the Prior
Team and another Team concerning the signing and subsequent
trade of such Contract, but only if (i) the Veteran Free Agent
finished the prior Season on his Prior Team's roster, (ii) the
Contract is for at least three (3) Seasons (excluding any Option
Year) but no more than four (4) Seasons in length, (iii) the
Contract is not signed pursuant to the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level
Salary Exception, the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception or the
Disabled Player Exception, (iv) the first Season of the Contract is
fully protected for lack of skill, (v) the Contract is entered into
prior to the first day of the Regular Season, (vi) with respect to
any 5th Year Eligible Player (as defined in Article II, Section 7)
who met one of the 5th Year 30% Max Criteria (as defined in
Article II, Section 7), the Contract may not provide the player
with Salary (plus Unlikely Bonuses) in excess of twenty-five
percent (25%) of the Salary Cap (as calculated pursuant to Article
II, Section 7) in effect at the time the Contract is signed, and
(vii) the acquiring Team has Room for the player's Salary plus any
Unlikely Bonuses provided for in the first Season of the Contract.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding
sentence, commencing with the 2013-14 Salary Cap Year, a Team
shall not be permitted to acquire a player pursuant to a Contract
entered into in accordance with this Section 8(e)(1) if the Team's
Team Salary following the proposed transaction would exceed the
Tax Level for such Salary Cap Year plus \$4 million, and if a Team
acquires a player pursuant to this Section 8(e)(1), then the Team's
Team Salary at all times thereafter during the Salary Cap Year maynot exceed the Tax Level for such Salary Cap Year plus \$4
million.
(2) A player and his Team may amend a Player Contract
(including by entering into an Extension but not by entering into a
Renegotiation) pursuant to an agreement between such Team and
another Team concerning the signing of the amendment and
subsequent trade of the amended Contract; provided, however,
that: (i) no such agreement may be made during the period from
the last day of the last Regular Season covered by the Contract (or
the last day of any Regular Season that could be the last Regular
Season covered by the Contract based upon the exercise or non-
exercise of an Option or ETO) through the following June 30;
and (ii) no such Extension entered into pursuant to this Section
8(e)(2) may cover more than three (3) Seasons from the date the
Extension is signed. The Salary and Unlikely Bonuses that may be
provided in the first year of the extended term and annual
increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be
governed by Section 7(a)(3)(ii) and Section 5(c)(5) above.
(3) A Player Contract or Extension entered into pursuant to
Section 8(e)(1) or (2) above may not contain an Exhibit 6 thereto.
However, the preceding sentence shall not prohibit the Teams
involved in the trade from agreeing that the trade (and thus the
validity of the Player Contract or Extension) will be conditional
upon the passage of a physical examination to be performed by a
physician designated by the assignee-Team in accordance with
NBA procedures.
(f) In the event a player enters into an Extension pursuant to Section
7(a) above that covers four (4) Seasons and/or provides for Salary and
Unlikely Bonuses or annual increases in the player's Salary and Unlikely
Bonuses in excess of the amounts permissible in connection with
Extensions entered in connection with an agreement to trade the Contract
pursuant to Section 8(e)(2) above, the player may not be traded
before six (6) months following the date on which such Extension was
signed. If a team acquires a player in a trade, then, for a period of six (6)
months following the date of the trade, the team may not enter into an
Extension with the player that provides for four (4) Seasons and/or
provides for Salary and Unlikely Bonuses or annual increases in the
player's Salary and Unlikely Bonuses in excess of the amounts permissiblein connection with Extensions entered in connection with an agreement to
trade the Contract pursuant to Section 8(e)(2) above.
(g) In the event a Rookie Scale Contract is extended pursuant to
Section 7(b) above and a Team proposes to trade such Contract to another
Team prior to the July 1 immediately following such extension, then, only
for purposes of determining whether the acquiring Team has Room for
the Contract, the Salary for the last Season of the original term of the
Contract shall be deemed to equal the average of the aggregate Salaries for
such Season and each Season of the extended term.
(h) If a Team trades a player and the assignee Team subsequently
places the player on waivers, the assignor Team shall not be permitted to
sign the player to a new Contract (or claim the player off of waivers)
before the earlier of: (i) one (1) year following the date all conditions to the
trade were satisfied; or (ii) the July 1 following the last Season of the
player's Player Contract.
(i) Prior to the assignment of any Player Contract, the Team from
which such Player Contract is to be assigned and the player whose Player
Contract is to be assigned shall be required to divest themselves, on terms
mutually agreeable to the player and the Team, of any pre-existing financial
arrangements between such Team and such player. The foregoing shall
not apply to Compensation earned by the player prior to the assignment or
to loans.
(j) Within one (1) week following each trade, the NBA shall send to
the Players Association, by fax or email, a summary of the principal terms
of the trade; provided, however, that the NBA may omit from such
summary any terms that the NBA or one (1) or more Teams involved in
the trade reasonably deem confidential (other than such terms as may be
necessary to verify the Teams' compliance with Section 8(a) above).
Section 9. Miscellaneous.
(a) Except where this Agreement states otherwise, for purposes of any
rule in this Agreement that limits, involves counting, or otherwise relates
to, the number of Seasons covered by a Contract:
(1) If a Player Contract or Extension is signed after the
beginning of a Season, the Season in which the Contract orExtension is signed shall be counted as one (1) full Season
covered by the Contract or Extension; and in the case of an
Extension that is signed during the period from the end of a
Season through the immediately following June 30, the Season
after which the Extension is signed (i.e., the just-completed
Season) shall be counted as one (1) full Season covered by the
Extension.
(2) An Option Year shall be counted as one (1) Season covered
by the Contract.
(b) Except where this Agreement states otherwise, all of the rules in
this Agreement that limit, affect the calculation of, or otherwise relate to,
the Compensation or Salary provided for in a Player Contract shall apply
to Option Years.
Section 10. Accounting Procedures.
(a) (1) The NBA and the Players Association shall jointly engage an
independent auditor (the "Accountants") to provide the parties
with an "Audit Report" (and a "Draft Audit Report," and, if
applicable, an "Interim Audit Report" and, if applicable, an
"Interim Escrow Audit Report") setting forth BRI, and Total
Salaries and Benefits for the immediately preceding Salary Cap
Year and the information called for by Section 12 below (the
"Escrow Information"). The audit reports provided for by this
Section 10(a)(1) are to be prepared in accordance with the
provisions and definitions contained in this Agreement. The
engagement of the Accountants shall be deemed to be renewed
annually unless they are discharged by either party during the
period from the submission of an Audit Report up to January 1 of
the following year. The parties agree to share equally the costs
incurred by the Accountants in preparing the audit reports
provided for by this Section 10(a)(1).
(2) The Accountants shall submit a "Draft Audit Report" for
each Salary Cap Year to the NBA and the Players Association,
along with relevant supporting documentation, two (2) weeks
prior to the scheduled issuance of the final Audit Report.(3) The final Audit Report shall be submitted by the Accountants
to the parties on or before the last day of the Moratorium Period
following the conclusion of the Salary Cap Year. The Audit
Report shall not be deemed final until the parties have confirmed
in writing their agreement (in a form acceptable to the parties)
with such Report. The NBA, the Players Association and the
Teams shall use their best efforts to facilitate the Accountants'
timely completion of the Audit Report.
(4) In the event that, for any reason, the Accountants fail to
submit to the parties a final Audit Report by the last day of the
Moratorium Period, the Accountants shall prepare an interim
Audit Report (the "Interim Audit Report") by such date setting
forth the Accountants' best estimate of BRI and Total Salaries
and Benefits for the preceding Salary Cap Year and, based upon
such best estimates, the Escrow Information. Such Interim Audit
Report shall include:
(i) All amounts of BRI and Total Salaries and Benefits (or the
portions thereof) and all Escrow Information (or the
portions thereof) for such Salary Cap Year as to which the
Accountants have completed their review and, by written
agreement of the Players Association and the NBA
(waiving their respective rights to dispute such amounts),
are not in dispute.
(ii) With respect to any amounts of BRI or Total Salaries and
Benefits (or portions thereof) as to which the Accountants
have not completed their review or which are the subject of
a good faith dispute between the parties, the NBA's good
faith proposal as to the proper amount, if any, that should
be included in the Audit Report.
(iii) With respect to any items of Escrow Information that are
the subject of a good faith dispute between the parties, the
Accountants' good faith determination as to such items,
taking into account the provisions of Section 10(a)(4) (i)
and (ii).
As soon as practicable after the Interim Audit Report is
submitted to the parties, the Accountants shall submit the finalAudit Report, including a description of the differences, if any,
from the Interim Audit Report. The Audit Report shall not be
deemed final until the parties have confirmed in writing their
agreement (in a form acceptable to the parties) with such Report
or all disputes with respect to such Report have been finally
resolved by means of the dispute-resolution procedures provided
for by this Agreement.
If, at the conclusion of the Audit Report Challenge Period (as
defined by Section 12(a)(5) below), the Accountants have not
submitted or are unable to submit a final Audit Report (because,
by way of example but not limitation, there are disputes or claims
that have been asserted pursuant to Article XXXII, Section 9(c)
and which remain pending), the Accountants shall prepare and
submit to the parties, within five (5) business days following the
completion of the Audit Report Challenge Period, an Interim
Escrow Audit Report that shall include the information set forth
in the Interim Audit Report as adjusted or amended so as to
reflect any final determinations made by the System Arbitrator or
the Appeals Panel (as the case may be) in proceedings
commenced pursuant to Article XXXII, Section 9(b) and
involving disputes or claims with respect to such Interim Audit
Report. The sole purpose for which any Interim Escrow Audit
Report is to be used under this Agreement is to perform or form
the basis for the calculations to be made pursuant to Section 12
below.
(b) For purposes of determining BRI, Total Salaries and Benefits and
the Escrow Information, the Accountants shall perform at least such
review procedures as shall be agreed upon by the parties. In connection
with the preparation of Audit Reports for each Salary Cap Year, each
Team and the NBA shall submit a report to the Accountants, the NBA
and the Players Association setting forth BRI, Team Salaries and Benefits
information for such Salary Cap Year, on forms agreed upon by the NBA,
the Players Association and the Accountants (the "BRI Reports"). The
NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon such forms no later
than May 1 of each Salary Cap Year.
(c) The Accountants shall review the reasonableness of any estimates
of revenues or expenses for a Salary Cap Year included in the Teams' andthe NBA's BRI Reports for such Salary Cap Year and may make such
adjustments in such estimates as they deem appropriate. To the extent the
actual amounts of revenues received or expenses incurred for a Salary Cap
Year differ from such estimates, adjustments shall be made in BRI for the
following Salary Cap Year in accordance with the provisions of Section
10(f) below.
(d) With respect to expenses deducted by the NBA or the Teams, the
NBA and the Teams shall report in BRI Reports only those expenses that
are reasonable and customary in accordance with the provisions of Section
1(a) above. Subject to the terms of Section 1(a)(6) above and Section 11
below, all categories of expenses deducted in a BRI Report completed by
the NBA or a Team shall be reviewed by the Accountants, but such
categories shall be presumed to be reasonable and customary and the
amount of the expenses deducted by the NBA or a Team that come within
such expense categories shall also be presumed to be reasonable and
customary, unless such categories or amounts are found by the
Accountants to be either unrelated to the revenues involved or grossly
excessive.
(e) The Accountants shall notify designated representatives of the
NBA and the Players Association: (1) if the Accountants have any
questions concerning the amounts of revenues or expenses reported by the
Teams and the NBA or any other information contained in the BRI
Reports; or (2) if the Accountants propose that any adjustments be made
to any revenue or expense item or any other information contained in the
BRI Reports.
(f) The Accountants shall indicate which amounts included in BRI for
a Salary Cap Year, if any, represent estimates of revenues. With respect to
any such estimated revenues, the Accountants shall, in preparing the Audit
Report for the immediately succeeding Salary Cap Year ("Subsequent
Audit Report"), or the Audit Report for the same Salary Cap Year in the
event that an Interim Audit Report was previously issued for that Salary
Cap Year, determine the actual revenues received for the prior Salary Cap
Year and include as a credit or debit to BRI in such Subsequent Audit
Report the amount of the aggregate difference, if any, between all such
estimated revenues for the prior Salary Cap Year and the actual revenues
received for such Salary Cap Year (the "Estimated Revenue Adjustment").(g) In the event that in the course of preparing an Audit Report for a
Salary Cap Year the Accountants discover that they committed an error in
computing BRI in the Audit Reports for either of the two (2) previous
Salary Cap Years, which error resulted in a material understatement or
overstatement of BRI for either of such Salary Cap Years, and the parties
agree that such error was committed and agree as to the amount of the
resulting understatement or overstatement (or, if they do not agree, an
error (and the amount of such error) is established pursuant to the dispute
resolution procedures provided for in this Agreement) the amount of such
understatement or overstatement of BRI shall be added to or subtracted
from BRI, as the case may be, with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1)
year Treasury Bill rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the date of
the issuance of such Audit Report) accruing from the date of the Audit
Report for the Salary Cap Year in which such understatement or
overstatement occurred in equal annual amounts over the then-current and
subsequent Salary Cap Years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
will jointly instruct the Accountants that their audits shall not include
procedures specifically designed to detect errors committed in prior audits.
(h) In the event that there is an NHL players' strike or owners' lockout
("work stoppage") resulting in the cancellation of all or part of any NHL
season in any Salary Cap Year, and such work stoppage results in a refund
being made to luxury suite-holders, premium seat license-holders or to
purchasers of fixed arena signage and/or naming rights in arenas in which
both an NBA Team and an NHL team plays its home games, then the
revenues for luxury suites, premium seat licenses and fixed arena signage
and/or naming rights in such arenas shall be determined as if such refunds
were not made. If the work stoppage continues for a second year, then the
NHL revenues shall be deemed to be the amount included for the prior
year.
(i) All disputes with respect to any Interim Audit Report shall be
resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article
XXXII.
Section 11. Players Association Audit Rights.
(a) Team Audits. The Players Association shall have the right as part
of the annual review of BRI Reports to retain its own accountants (the
"Players Association's Accountants"), at its own expense, after the
submission of each Audit Report under this Agreement (the "FirstAudit"), to audit the books and records of up to five (5) NBA teams (of its
choosing) and shall also have the right to review the books and records of
the NBA League Office; provided, however, that such review shall be
limited to (1) revenue items, and (2) expense items that appear or should
have appeared in the BRI Reports. In the event that, in the opinion of the
Players Association's Accountants, such audit indicates misallocations or
miscategorizations of revenues or expenses (other than with respect to
matters that constituted Disputed Adjustments in connection with the
prior Audit Report) resulting in an understatement of BRI in excess of \$3
million, they shall submit to the NBA proposed adjustments to BRI
consistent with their findings. In the event that the NBA disputes such
proposed adjustments, such proposed adjustments shall be deemed to be
"Disputed Adjustments" and shall be resolved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Article XXXII. In addition, in the event that First
Audit Disputed Adjustments in excess of \$3 million are resolved in favor
of the Players Association, the Players Association shall then have the
right, that Season, to have the Players Association's Accountants audit up
to an additional five (5) NBA teams, in accordance with the foregoing
procedures (the "Second Audit"). If, as a result of the Second Audit,
additional Disputed Adjustments in excess of \$3 million are resolved in
favor of the Players Association, the Players Association shall then have
the right, that Season, to have the Players Association's Accountants audit
all remaining NBA Teams. The amount of any and all Disputed
Adjustments that are ultimately resolved in favor of the Players
Association in accordance with this Section 11(a) shall be added to BRI in
the Season in which such resolution is reached.
(b) Expense Audit. The Players Association shall have the right to
retain the Players Association's Accountants to conduct one (1) audit, at its
own expense, of the expenses incurred in connection with the proceeds
that come within Section 1(a)(1)(ix) above regardless of whether such
expenses exceed the applicable BRI Expense Ratios set forth in Exhibit D.
In the event that in the opinion of the Players Association's Accountants,
such audit indicates a misallocation or miscategorization of expenses
resulting in an understatement of BRI, they shall submit proposed
adjustments to the NBA consistent with their findings. In the event the
NBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed adjustments
shall be deemed to be Disputed Adjustments and resolved in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Article XXXII. The amount of any and all
such Disputed Adjustments that are resolved in the Players Association'sfavor shall be included in BRI in the Season in which such resolution is
reached. In addition, in the event that any such Disputed Adjustments are
resolved in the Players Association's favor, the Accountants shall be
directed to correct such expense misallocations and/or miscategorizations
in the remaining Seasons covered by the Agreement.
(c) Confidentiality. In connection with any audit conducted by the
Players Association pursuant to this Section 11, the Players Association
agrees to sign, and to cause its representatives to sign, a confidentiality
agreement in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit J-1. The Players
Association also agrees to sign, and to cause its representatives to sign, a
similar confidentiality agreement with respect to information obtained in
connection with the Accountants' audit pursuant to Section 10 above.

below, shall be an amount determined by the following
calculation:
STEP 1: Compute fifty-three and fifty-one one
hundredths percent (53.51%) of Projected BRI
(as defined in Section 1(c) above).
STEP 2: Subtract Projected Benefits (as defined in Article
IV, Section 9) for such Salary Cap Year from the
result in Step 1.
STEP 3: Divide the result in Step 2 by the number of
Teams scheduled to play in the NBA during such
Salary Cap Year (excluding Expansion Teams
during their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the
NBA).The Tax Level with respect to the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year

Section 12(a)(17)(i) above, less Projected benefits for such
Salary Cap Year (including for the Expansion Team(s)),
divided by the number of Teams scheduled to play in the
NBA during such Salary Cap Year (including the
Expansion Team(s)), exceeds the Salary Cap calculated in
accordance with Section 12(a)(17)(i) above, the Salary Cap
shall equal the amount calculated pursuant to this Section
12(a)(17)(ii).
(iii) The Tax Level for a Salary Cap Year will be in effect
commencing on the day following the last day of the
Moratorium Period in such Salary Cap Year and shall
continue through and including the last day of the
Moratorium Period in the next Salary Cap Year.
(iv) In the event that the Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year
has not been completed as of the last day of the
Moratorium Period immediately following the end of such
Salary Cap Year and the NBA and the Players Association
have not reached agreement on Projected BRI and
Projected Benefits pursuant to Section 1 above and Article
IV, Section 9 for the Salary Cap Year that commenced on
the immediately preceding July 1, then the Tax Level for
the Salary Cap Year that commenced on such immediately
preceding July 1 will be calculated using Interim Projected
BRI instead of Projected BRI, Estimated BRI instead of
BRI and Estimated Benefits instead of Benefits for all
purposes under this Section 12(a)(17) including, withoutlimitation, the adjustments set forth in Section 12(a)(17)(vi)
or (vii) below. In the event that the Interim Audit Report
for the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year has not been completed as
of the last day of the Moratorium Period immediately
following the end of such Salary Cap Year and the NBA
and Players Association have not reached agreement on
Projected BRI and Projected Benefits pursuant to Section 1
above and Article IV, Section 9, then the Tax Level for the
2012-13 Salary Cap Year shall, until such Interim Audit
Report is completed, be \$70.307 million. In the event that
the Interim Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year, beginning
with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year, has not been completed
as of the last day of the Moratorium Period immediately
following the end of such Salary Cap Year, and the NBA
and Players Association have not reached agreement on
Projected BRI and Projected Benefits pursuant to Section 1
above and Article IV, Section 9, then the Tax Level for the
Salary Cap Year that commenced on the immediately
preceding July 1 shall, until such Interim Audit Report is
completed, be an amount that would have been the Tax
Level for the preceding Salary Cap Year had Projected BRI
or Interim Projected BRI, as the case may be, for such
preceding Salary Cap Year included, with respect to the
NBA's national broadcast, national telecast or network
cable television contracts, the rights fees or other non-
contingent payments stated in such contracts for the
Season following the Season covered by such preceding
Salary Cap Year instead of for the Season covered by such
preceding Salary Cap Year.
(v) In the event that the Tax Level for a Salary Cap Year is
calculated in accordance with Section 12(a)(17)(iv) above
(i.e., is based upon an Interim Audit Report for the prior
Salary Cap Year) and BRI and Benefits as set forth in the
Audit Report for the prior Salary Cap Year are different
from those in the Interim Audit Report such that the Tax
Level would have been different from that based upon the
Interim Audit Report, any such difference in the Tax Level
shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to the Tax
Level for the subsequent Salary Cap Year, except that, withrespect to the 2020-21 Salary Cap Year (or, in the
alternative, if either the NBA or the Players Association
exercises its option to terminate this Agreement following
the 2016-17 Salary Cap Year pursuant to Article XXXIX,
the 2016-17 Salary Cap Year) any such differences shall be
debited or credited, as the case may be, to the Tax Level
for the then-current Salary Cap Year, in all such cases with
interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate
as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the
issuance of the Interim Audit Report).
(vi) In the event that Total Salaries and Benefits for any Salary
Cap Year beginning with the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year are
less than the Designated Share for such Salary Cap Year,
then the Tax Level for the subsequent Salary Cap Year
shall be increased by the amount of the shortfall divided by
the number of Teams in the NBA during such subsequent
Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their first
two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA).
(vii) In the event that there is an Overage (as defined in Section
12(a)(14) above) in any Salary Cap Year beginning with the
2012-13 Salary Cap Year, then the Tax Level for the
subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be adjusted as follows:
(A) If the amount of the Overage in a Salary Cap Year is
equal to or less than six percent (6%) of Total Salaries
and Benefits, then no adjustments shall be made to
the Tax Level for the subsequent Salary Cap Year.
(B) If the amount of the Overage in a Salary Cap Year
equals more than six percent (6%) of Total Salaries
and Benefits, then the Tax Level for the subsequent
Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by an amount to be
calculated as follows:
STEP 1: Subtract six percent (6%) of Total Salaries
and Benefits from the Overage.
STEP 2: If Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year does
not exceed BRI for the prior Salary CapYear by more than eight percent (8%) of
BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year or if the
amount of the Overage described above
exceeds nine percent (9%) of Total Salaries
and Benefits, then divide the result of Step
1 by the number of Teams in the NBA
during the subsequent Salary Cap Year
(other than Expansion Teams in their first
two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The
result of this calculation is the amount of
the reduction in the Tax Level for such
subsequent Salary Cap Year, and no further
steps are required.
If Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year exceeds BRI
for the prior Salary Cap Year by more than eight
percent (8%) of BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year
and the amount of the Overage described above does
not exceed nine percent (9%) of Total Salaries and
Benefits, then proceed to Step 3.
STEP 3: Subtract BRI for the prior Salary Cap Year
from Projected BRI for the Salary Cap
Year.
STEP 4: Subtract eight percent (8%) of BRI for the
prior Salary Cap Year from the result of
Step 3.
STEP 5: Multiply the result of Step 4 by fifty-three
and fifty-one one hundredths percent
(53.51%).
STEP 6: Subtract the result of Step 5 from the result
of Step 1. If the result of this step is less
than zero, then no adjustments shall be
made to the Tax Level for the subsequent
Salary Cap Year, and no further steps are
required.STEP 7: Divide the result of Step 6 by the number
of Teams in the NBA during such
subsequent Salary Cap Year (other than
Expansion Teams in their first two (2)
Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The result
of this step is the amount of the reduction
in the Tax Level for such subsequent Salary
Cap Year.
Example: Assume Total Salaries and Benefits for the 2013-14 Season are
\$2.27 billion and the Designated Share is \$2.1 billion resulting in an Overage of \$170
million (which equals 7.5% of Total Salaries and Benefits). Assume Projected BRI for
the 2014-15 Season (\$4.41 billion) exceeds actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2
billion) by 5%. Assume there are 30 Teams in the NBA in 2014-15. The Tax
Level for the 2014-15 Season would be reduced by \$1.1 million ((7.5% of Total
Salaries and Benefits (\$170 million) less 6% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$136
million)) divided by 30).
Example: Same Total Salaries and Benefits as in the prior example, except
assume Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season (\$4.578 billion) exceeds actual BRI for
the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2 billion) by 9%. The Tax Level for the 2014-15 Season
would be reduced by \$0.38 million (\$34 million (the Overage of 7.5% of Total Salaries
and Benefits (\$170 million) less 6% of Total Salaries and Benefits (\$136 million)),
less \$22.5 million (i.e., the difference between (x) Projected BRI for the 2014-15
Season (\$4.578 billion) less actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (\$4.2 billion) (i.e.,
\$378 million) and (y) 8% of actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (i.e., \$336 million) -
- a difference of \$42 million -- multiplied by 53.51%), divided by 30).
(18) "Trade Bonus Deduction Date" means, with respect to an
Adjustment Player, the earlier of (i) the date that any trade bonus
earned by the player during the applicable Salary Cap Year is paid
to the player pursuant to this Contract, or (ii) the June 30 of such
Salary Cap Year.
(b) Compensation Adjustment Rules.
(1) In the event that there is an Overage in any Salary Cap Year,
(i) the Contracts of all Adjustment Players shall be amended by
operation of this Agreement, such that the aggregate
Compensation otherwise payable to all such Adjustment Players
with respect to such Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by theAggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount, (ii) the New
Benefit Amount for such Season as provided for by Article IV,
Section 8(a)(1) (i.e., the New Benefit amount that is presently
specified in Article IV, Section 8(a)(1) or such lesser New Benefit
Amount as is designated by the Players Association, in accordance
with the provisions of Article IV, Section 8(a)(1), by notice in
writing to the NBA delivered on or before the March 15 prior to
the commencement of the Salary Cap Year encompassing such
Season) shall be reduced by the New Benefit Adjustment
Amount, and (iii) the Additional Benefit Amount as provided for
by Article IV, Section 4(c) (i.e., the one percent (1%) of BRI for
additional benefits) shall be reduced by any remaining Overage
after applying the reductions set forth in Section 12(b)(1)(i)-(ii).
(2) Subject to Section 12(d) and (e) below, to effectuate the
aggregate Compensation reduction provided for in Section
12(b)(1)(i) above, the Compensation otherwise payable in
accordance with each Adjustment Player's Contract shall be
reduced by the player's respective Individual Compensation
Adjustment Amount.
(3) The Designated Share for the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year shall
equal fifty-one and fifteen one hundredths percent (51.15%) of
BRI for such Salary Cap Year. Commencing with the 2012-13
Salary Cap Year, the Designated Share for each Salary Cap Year
for the remainder of the term of this Agreement shall equal fifty
percent (50%) of BRI for such Salary Cap Year, provided that the
Designated Share for a Salary Cap Year shall be increased or
decreased in accordance with the following: (i) in the event that
BRI for a Salary Cap Year exceeds the amount of BRI forecasted
for such Salary Cap Year as set forth below, then the Designated
Share for such Salary Cap Year shall equal fifty percent (50%) of
the amount of BRI forecasted for such Salary Cap Year, plus
sixty and one-half percent (60.5%) of the difference between the
BRI for such Salary Cap Year and the BRI forecasted for such
Salary Cap Year; and (ii) in the event that BRI forecasted for a
Salary Cap Year as set forth below exceeds BRI for such Salary
Cap Year, then the Designated Share for such Salary Cap Year
shall equal fifty percent (50%) of the amount of BRI forecasted
for such Salary Cap Year, less sixty and one-half percent (60.5%)of the difference between the BRI forecasted for such Salary Cap
Year and BRI for such Salary Cap Year. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in no event shall the
Designated Share for any Salary Cap Year commencing with the
2012-13 Salary Cap Year be less than forty-nine percent (49%) of
BRI or greater than fifty-one percent (51%) of BRI. To illustrate
the foregoing, (X) if BRI for the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year were to
equal \$4.408 billion, then the Designated Share for the 2012-13
Salary Cap Year would equal \$2.2145 billion (\$2.154 billion
(forecasted BRI of \$4.308 billion multiplied by 50%) plus \$60.5
million (60.5% of \$100 million -- the difference between BRI of
\$4.408 billion and forecasted BRI of \$4.308 billion), which would
equate to 50.24% of BRI; (Y) if BRI for the 2012-13 Salary Cap
Year were to equal \$4.208 billion, then the Designated Share for
the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year would equal \$2.0935 billion (\$2.154
billion (forecasted BRI of \$4.308 billion multiplied by 50%) less
\$60.5 million (60.5% of \$100 million -- the difference between
forecasted BRI of \$4.308 billion and BRI of \$4.208 billion), which
would equate to 49.75% of BRI; and (Z) if BRI for the 2014-15
Salary Cap Year were to equal \$5.2 billion, then the Designated
Share for the 2014-15 Salary Cap Year would equal \$2.652 billion
or 51% of BRI (since the amount per the calculation would
exceed 51% of BRI -- \$2.330 billion (forecasted BRI of \$4.660
billion multiplied by 50%) plus \$326.7 million (60.5% of \$540
million -- the difference between BRI of \$5.2 billion and
forecasted BRI of \$4.660 billion) would equal \$2.657 billion or
51.1% of BRI).
Salary Cap Year Forecasted BRI
2012-13 \$4.308 billion
2013-14 \$4.481 billion
2014-15 \$4.660 billion
2015-16 \$4.870 billion
2016-17 \$5.089 billion
2017-18 \$5.318 billion
2018-19 \$5.557 billion
2019-20 \$5.807 billion
2020-21 \$6.069 billion(c) Escrow Procedure.
(1) The following shall apply with respect to each Salary Cap
Year (subject to Section 12(d) below regarding final
reconciliation):
(i) The Compensation otherwise payable to each Adjustment
Player shall be reduced by the Escrow Amount applicable
to such Adjustment Player; and
(ii) Each Team shall deposit the Escrow Amount with respect
to each of its Adjustment Players with the Escrow Agent.
(2) Except as set forth in Section 12(c)(4) below: (i) the Base
Escrow Amount for each Adjustment Player shall be collected in
twelve (12) equal installments from each of the player's semi-
monthly Compensation payments on each Deduction Date;
(ii) the Performance Bonus Escrow Amount for each Adjustment
Player shall be collected in one (1) installment on the Performance
Bonus Deduction Date; and (iii) the Trade Bonus Escrow
Amount for each Adjustment Player shall be collected in one (1)
installment on the Trade Bonus Deduction Date.
(3) The procedure for deducting and depositing Escrow
Amounts shall be as follows:
(i) The NBA will prepare and send to the Players Association
the Escrow Schedules on or before November 8 of each
Salary Cap Year, and periodically thereafter to reflect any
new or adjusted Escrow Amounts calculated in accordance
with Section 12 (c)(4) below.
(ii) (A) Within three (3) business days after each Deduction
Date, each Team shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, in
accordance with the Salary Escrow Agreement, the
aggregate Base Escrow Amounts that the Team is
obligated to deduct with respect to such Deduction
Date for all of its Adjustment Players. Within three
(3) business days following the date of the last game of
the NBA Finals occurring during each Salary Cap
Year, each Team shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, inaccordance with the Salary Escrow Agreement, the
aggregate Performance Bonus Escrow Amounts for all
of its Adjustment Players. Within three (3) business
days following an Adjustment Player's Trade Bonus
Deduction Date, the player's Team shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent, in accordance with the Salary Escrow
Agreement, the player's Trade Bonus Escrow
Amount. All amounts received by the Escrow Agent
shall be invested and disbursed in accordance with the
provisions of the Salary Escrow Agreement.
(B) It is the intention of the NBA and the Players
Association that the provisions of this Section 12(c)
result each Salary Cap Year in the delivery to the
Escrow Agent, with respect to each Adjustment
Player, of the player's full Escrow Amount.
Accordingly, if for any reason the procedures in this
Section 12(c) would result in less than the full Escrow
Amount with respect to any Adjustment Player being
delivered to the Escrow Agent, the NBA and the
Players Association shall agree on such supplemental
measures as are necessary to effectuate the deduction
of the appropriate amount from the player's
Compensation for delivery to the Escrow Agent.
(4) After November 8, the NBA shall periodically update the
Escrow Schedules to add Escrow Amounts for players who enter
into new Player Contracts and to make such adjustments as may
be necessary to previously-listed Escrow Amounts (such as
adjustments resulting from earned Performance Bonuses,
Contract terminations, Renegotiations, etc.). Any portion of a
Base Escrow Amount that has not been deducted as of the date
any such updated Schedules are prepared shall be deducted in
equal installments from each of the remaining semi-monthly
Compensation payments to be made to the player from
November 15 through May 1 of the applicable Salary Cap Year.
(5) Within seven (7) days after receiving any set of Escrow
Schedules from the NBA, or within seven (7) days after any event
that the Players Association believes warrants a change in any
previously-issued Schedules, the Players Association may bring aproceeding before the System Arbitrator, in accordance with
Article XXXII, Section 10, contesting the NBA's calculation of
any player's Escrow Amount for such Salary Cap Year.
Notwithstanding the commencement of any such proceeding,
each Team shall commence and continue remitting to the Escrow
Agent the total deductions due with respect to each Deduction
Date and each Performance Bonus Deduction Date as set forth in
the Schedules, and in no event shall any Team be prohibited from
remitting to the Escrow Agent any such deduction prior to a final
determination in any such proceeding.
(6) In the event that the NBA makes a determination in
accordance with Section 12(c)(4) above, or a final determination is
made in a proceeding in accordance with Section 12(c)(5) above,
that an Escrow Amount was erroneously calculated by the NBA,
the sole remedy with respect to any amounts erroneously
deducted from the player's Salary shall be to modify, as soon as
practicable, the deduction schedule applicable to such player so as
to reduce, in equal amounts, all scheduled future deductions from
post-determination payments of Compensation until the amount
of any prior over-deduction is fully off-set; provided, however,
that to the extent that reducing the player's future deductions
would not fully offset the prior over-deductions, the parties shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the player as soon as practicable,
with interest, such additional amounts as are necessary to fully
off-set such over-deductions.
(d) Reconciliation Procedures.
(1) In the event of an Overage: (i) the NBA shall be entitled to
receive from the Escrow Agent, with respect to each Adjustment
Player, such player's Individual Compensation Adjustment
Amount (or, in the event that the player's Escrow Amount is less
than his Individual Compensation Adjustment Amount, a portion
of his Individual Compensation Adjustment Amount equal to his
Escrow Amount); and (ii) each Adjustment Player shall be entitled
to receive from the Escrow Agent the amount, if any, by which
the player's Escrow Amount exceeds his Individual
Compensation Adjustment Amount. In the event that there is no
Overage, each Adjustment Player shall be entitled to receive from
the Escrow Agent his entire Escrow Amount.(2) Any interest earned on Escrow Amounts remitted to the
Escrow Agent shall be allocated among the Adjustment Players,
collectively, and the NBA in proportion to the percentage of the
aggregate Escrow Amounts that the Adjustment Players,
collectively, and the NBA are to receive from the Escrow Agent
in accordance with Section 12(d)(1) above. The Adjustment
Players' collective share of interest shall be allocated among the
individual players in proportion to the amount each player is

above, the parties shall cause the Accountants to include in the
Audit Report (or, if no final Audit Report has been submitted at
the conclusion of the Audit Report Challenge Period, in the
Interim Escrow Audit Report) a separate Notice to the NBA andthe Players Association, in the form attached to the Salary Escrow
Agreement, setting forth:
(i) in the space designated in paragraph 1 of the Notice, the
sum of the amounts described in Section 12(d)(3)(vii)(D)
and Section 12(d)(3)(viii)(E) above, which sum is to be
disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the NBA;
(ii) in the space designated in paragraph 2 of the Notice, the
amounts described in Section 12(d)(3)(viii)(C) above, which
amounts are to be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to each
respective Adjustment Player described in Section
12(d)(3)(viii) above;
(iii) in the space designated in paragraph 3 of the Notice, the
information described in Section 12(d)(3)(ix)(A) above,
which information shall be the basis for the Escrow

Agent to the NBA; and
(iv) in the space designated in paragraph (4) of the Notice, the
information described in Section 12(d)(3)(ix)(C) above,
which information shall be the basis for the Escrow
Agent's calculation of interest earned on the Escrow
Amounts, which interest is to be disbursed by the Escrow

(5) No later than seven (7) business days after the earlier of
(i) the completion of the Audit Report for the prior Salary Cap
Year, or (ii) the completion of the Audit Report Challenge Period,
the NBA and/or the Players Association shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent the completed Notice to the NBA and the Players
Association. As soon as practicable following receipt of such
Notice, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the specified sums to the
specified payees.
(6) Any amounts that the Escrow Agent is obligated to disburse
to a player pursuant to this Section 12, including the amounts
described in Section 12(d)(4)(iv) above, shall be reduced by all
amounts required to be withheld by federal, state, and localauthorities, which withholdings shall be disbursed by the Escrow
Agent to the player's Team for remittance to the appropriate
authorities. To assist the Escrow Agent in disbursing the
appropriate amounts to each Adjustment Player and his respective
Team, each Team, based on the information set forth in
paragraph 2 and paragraph 4 of the Notice to the NBA and the
Players Association, shall promptly provide the Escrow Agent
with a schedule for each of its Adjustment Players showing the
exact withholding amount to be disbursed to the Team for
remittance to the appropriate federal, state and local authorities.
In no circumstance shall the employer's share of FICA, FUTA, or
any other employer taxes be paid out of the amounts deposited in
escrow or any interest or earnings thereon. Any such obligations
shall remain with each player's individual employer.
(e) Aggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount Shortfalls.
(1) If, with respect to any Salary Cap Year, there is an Aggregate
Compensation Adjustment Amount Shortfall, then the Contract
of each of the following Salary Cap Year's Adjustment Players
shall be amended by operation of this Agreement, in accordance
with Section 12(e)(2) below, such that the aggregate
Compensation paid to all such players with respect to the Season
covered by such following Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by the
Aggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount Shortfall, which
reduction shall be in addition to the full amount of any reduction
for such following Salary Cap Year called for in Section 12(b)(1)-
(2) above.
(2) The Individual Shortfall Adjustment Amount for each
Adjustment Player whose Contract is amended in accordance with
Section 12(e)(1) above shall be calculated by multiplying the
Aggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount Shortfall for the
prior Salary Cap Year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
player's then-current Salary, and the denominator of which is the
sum of all such players' then-current Salaries. For purposes of
calculating the fraction described in the preceding sentence, the
Salary of a player making the Minimum Player Salary shall include
the portion of such Minimum Player Salary that is reimbursed out
of the League-wide benefits fund described in Article IV,
Section 6(k)(2).(3) The Individual Shortfall Adjustment Amount for each
Adjustment Player shall be deducted by the player's Team in
four (4) equal installments from each of the player's first four (4)
semi-monthly payment dates under paragraph 3 of the Uniform
Player Contract following delivery to the Escrow Agent of the
completed Notice to the NBA and the Players Association. All
such deductions shall be promptly remitted by the Teams to the
NBA.
(f) Team Payments.
(1) Each Team whose Team Salary exceeds the Tax Level for
any Salary Cap Year shall be required to pay a tax to the NBA.
(i) For the 2011-12 and 2012-13 Salary Cap Years, the tax
shall be equal to the amount by which the Team's Team
Salary exceeds the Tax Level.
(ii) For the 2013-14 Salary Cap Year, the tax shall be calculated
as follows:
Incremental Team
Salary Above
Tax Level Tax Rate for Increment
\$0 – \$4,999,999 \$1.50-for-\$1
\$5,000,000 – \$9,999,999 \$1.75-for-\$1
\$10,000,000 – \$14,999,999 \$2.50-for-\$1
\$15,000,000 – \$19,999,999 \$3.25-for-\$1
\$20,000,000 and over Tax rates increase by
\$0.50 for each additional
\$5,000,000 increment
above the Tax Level (e.g.,
for Team Salary
\$20,000,000 to
\$24,999,999 above the
Tax Level, the Tax rate is
\$3.75-for-\$1 for that
increment).Example: In 2013-14, a Team with Team Salary that exceeds
the Tax Level by \$11 million would pay a tax of \$18.75 million
(i.e., \$5 million times \$1.50, plus \$5 million times \$1.75, plus \$1
million times \$2.50).
(iii) For the 2014-15 Salary Cap Year, the tax shall be calculated
(A) using the rates in Section 12(f)(1)(ii) for teams whose
Team Salary did not exceed the Tax Level in any one of the
2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 Salary Cap Years, and (B)
using the rates shown below for teams whose Team Salary
exceeded the Tax Level in all of the 2011-12, 2012-13, and
2013-14 Salary Cap Years:
Incremental Team
Salary Above
Tax Level Tax Rate for Increment
\$0 – \$4,999,999 \$2.50-for-\$1
\$5,000,000 – \$9,999,999 \$2.75-for-\$1
\$10,000,000 – \$14,999,999 \$3.50-for-\$1
\$15,000,000 – \$19,999,999 \$4.25-for-\$1
\$20,000,000 and over Tax rates increase by
\$0.50 for each additional
\$5,000,000 increment
above the Tax Level (e.g.,
for Team Salary
\$20,000,000 to
\$24,999,999 above the
Tax Level, the Tax rate is
\$4.75-for-\$1 for that
increment).
Example: In 2014-15, a Team (whose Team Salary exceeded
the Tax Level in all the 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 Salary
Cap Years) with Team Salary that exceeds the Tax Level by \$11
million would pay a tax of \$29.75 million (i.e., \$5 million times
\$2.50, plus \$5 million times \$2.75, plus \$1 million times \$3.50).
(iv) For the 2015-16 Salary Cap Year and each subsequent
Salary Cap Year, the tax for the Salary Cap Year shall be
calculated (A) using the rates in Section 12(f)(1)(ii) for any
team whose Team Salary did not exceed the Tax Level inthree (3) or more of the four (4) Salary Cap Years
immediately preceding the current Salary Cap Year, and (B)
using the rates shown in Section 12(f)(1)(iii) for any team
whose Team Salary exceeded the Tax Level in three (3) or
more of the four (4) Salary Cap Years immediately
preceding the current Salary Cap Year.
(2) For purposes of computing the amount of tax a Team owes:
(i) a Team's Team Salary shall be the sum of: (A) its Team Salary
as of the start of its last Regular Season game, plus all
Performance Bonuses excluded from Salary under Article VII,
Section 3(d) but actually earned by the player during such Salary
Cap Year, less all Performance Bonuses included in Salary under
Section 3(d) above but not actually earned by the player during
such Salary Cap Year; plus (B) with respect to any trade that
occurs following the conclusion of the Team's last Regular Season
game, the portion of any trade bonus earned by a player that is
included in the Team's Team Salary for such Salary Cap Year, plus
(C) any amount that is added to the Team's Team Salary for such
Salary Cap Year following the start of the Team's last Regular
Season game pursuant to Section 4(a)(1)(iii) above; and (ii) the
Salary attributable to a Contract between a Team and a Free
Agent with zero (0) Years of Service or one (1) Year of Service
shall be deemed to be the greater of (x) such Salary or (y) the
Minimum Player Salary that would be applicable to a player with
two (2) Years of Service.
(3) Each Team that owes a tax shall make the required tax
payment to the NBA no later than ten (10) business days
following the earlier of (i) the completion of the Audit Report for
the prior Salary Cap Year, or (ii) the completion of the Audit
Report Challenge Period.
(4) For purposes of this Section 12(f) and subject to the
provisions of Section 12(f)(1) above and Section 12(f)(5) below,
Team Salary shall be calculated by the Accountants in the same
manner as Team Salary is calculated by the Accountants for
purposes of computing Total Salaries and Benefits in the Audit
Report.(5) During the term of this Agreement, each Team shall be
permitted to designate one (1) Amnesty Player whose Salary will
be excluded from his Team's Team Salary for each Salary Cap
Year covered by the remaining term of the player's Contract. An
"Amnesty Player" is a player who (i) was signed to a Contract by a
Team prior to July 1, 2011 or whose Contract was acquired by a
Team prior to July 1, 2011 (and whose Contract has at least one
(1) Remaining Protected Year and has not been extended,
renegotiated or otherwise amended since July 1, 2011) and who
remains on the Team's roster pursuant to such Contract as of the
effective date of this Agreement and until the date of the Amnesty
designation, or (ii) was waived by a Team prior to July 1, 2011 and
whose Salary continues to be included on such Team's Team
Salary. The procedures governing the designation of Amnesty
Players are set forth in Section 12(j) below.
(g) Escrow and Tax Proceeds. All amounts remitted to the NBA by
the Escrow Agent or NBA Teams pursuant to this Section 12 shall be the
exclusive property of the NBA, and the use and/or disposition of all such
amounts, including the allocation or distribution of such amounts to one
(1) or more NBA Teams, if any, shall be subject only to the following
limitations:
(1) The Escrow Amounts remitted to the NBA by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to Section 12(d) above with respect to each Salary
Cap Year shall be used and/or distributed as follows:
(i) the NBA may elect to distribute all or a portion of such
amounts to NBA teams, provided that any such
distribution pursuant to this Section 12(g)(1)(i) must be
made to all Teams in equal shares; and
(ii) amounts not distributed in accordance with Section
12(g)(1)(i) above shall be used for one (1) or more "League
purposes" (as defined in Section 12(g)(3) below) selected
by the NBA.
(2) The tax amounts remitted to the NBA by NBA Teams
pursuant to Section 12(f) above for each Salary Cap Year shall be
used and/or distributed as follows:(i) the NBA may elect to distribute up to fifty percent (50%)
of such amounts to one (1) or more Teams based in whole
or in part on the fact that such Team(s) did not owe a tax
for such Salary Cap Year (e.g., the NBA could elect to
distribute fifty percent (50%) of such amounts in equal
shares to all non-taxpayers in such Salary Cap Year); and
(ii) amounts not distributed in accordance with Section
12(g)(2)(i) above shall be used for one (1) or more "League
purposes" (as defined in Section 12(g)(3) below) selected
by the NBA.
(3) For purposes of this Section 12(g), the use of Escrow
Amounts or tax amounts for a "League purpose" shall mean the
use of such amounts for any purpose, including, but not limited to,
the distribution of such amounts to one (1) or more Teams;
provided, however, that such amounts may not be distributed to a
Team or expended for the benefit or detriment of a Team in a
manner that is based, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, on
the amount of the Team's Team Salary or on whether the Team is
a taxpayer. Without limiting the foregoing, a team assistance plan
adopted by the NBA and funded, in whole or in part, with Escrow
Amounts and/or tax amounts shall be considered a "League
purpose" if, pursuant to the plan, a Team's entitlement to an
assistance receipt and/or the amount of such receipt is based, in
whole or in part, on a profit, loss, and/or expense computation
determined by the NBA under which the Team is credited with a
Team Salary no less than the league average; provided, however,
that in order to qualify as a "League purpose," such a plan may not
otherwise base a Team's entitlement to assistance and/or the
amount of such assistance on the amount of a Team's Team Salary
or on whether the Team is a taxpayer.
(h) Revenue Decline. If BRI for any Salary Cap Year substantially
decreases from the prior Salary Cap Year's BRI, and, as a result, the players
receive more than the Designated Share (as defined in Section 12(b)(3)
above) for such Salary Cap Year, then the NBA and the Players
Association shall negotiate in good faith to agree upon an adjustment to
the provisions of this Agreement in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
parties to address the issue.(i) Miscellaneous.
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
computation of an Adjustment Player's Salary shall for purposes
of the rules set forth in this Agreement be made without regard to
any reduction in such player's Compensation made pursuant to
this Section 12.
(2) The NBA shall be permitted to assign to such designee, as
the NBA may determine, any rights the NBA has to receive
amounts from the Escrow Agent or NBA Teams pursuant to this
Section 12.
(3) Consistent with Section 3(f) above (One-Year Minimum
Contracts), except for purposes of calculating the amounts
referred to in the definitions of Escrow Amount, Individual
Compensation Adjustment Amount, and Individual Shortfall
Adjustment Amount (set forth in Sections 12(a)(9), (a)(11), and
(a)(12) above), and subject to Section 12(f)(2)(ii) above, the Salary
of every player who signs a one-year Contract after the date of
this Agreement for the Minimum Player Salary applicable to such
player shall, for all other purposes in this Section 12, be the lesser
of (i) such Minimum Player Salary, or (ii) the portion of such
Minimum Player Salary that is not reimbursed out of the League-
wide benefits fund described in Article IV, Section 6(k)(2).
(4) (i) For purposes of the computations made by the
Accountants pursuant to Section 10 above and this Section 12, the
Salary of a player who is suspended by the NBA – but not by a
Team – shall be reduced (for the Salary Cap Year covering the
Season during which the player is suspended) by an amount equal
to fifty percent (50%) of the suspension-related Compensation
amount that is collected from the player and retained by the NBA
at the time the computations of the Accountants are made. Other
than as set forth in the preceding sentence, the computation of a
player's Salary under this Agreement shall be made without regard
to any reduction in Compensation that results from the player's
suspension by the NBA or his Team.
(ii) When (A) a player has forfeited a portion of his
Compensation for a Season as a result of a suspensionimposed by the NBA or his Team and (B) the player's
Compensation is later reduced pursuant to Section 12(b)(1)
and (2) above, the player shall be entitled to a refund of a
portion of the Compensation forfeited as a result of the
suspension. The refund shall be in an amount equal to
(x) the player's Individual Compensation Adjustment
Amount for the Salary Cap Year to which the suspension
related multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the amount of the player's Compensation that was forfeited
as a result of the suspension and the denominator of which
is the player's Base Compensation for such Season as of
the date(s) he served the suspension, less (y) all amounts
required to be withheld by federal, state, and local
authorities. For purposes of the calculation required in
clause (x) above, a player's Individual Compensation
Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to include only the
portion of the player's Individual Compensation
Adjustment Amount that relates to the player's Base
Compensation earned under the Player Contract for the
NBA team that the player was playing for while he was
suspended. Such refund shall be made to the player within
thirty (30) days following the Accountants' submission to
the NBA and the Players Association of a final Audit
Report or an Interim Escrow Audit Report for the Salary
Cap Year covering the Season for which the suspension-
related Compensation amount is collected.
(5) In the event that the Overage for any Salary Cap Year
exceeds the total of (i) the Aggregate Salaries and Benefits
Adjustment Amount for such Salary Cap Year, plus (ii) the
Additional Benefit Amount as provided for by Article IV, Section
4(c) for such Salary Cap Year, the NBA shall not be entitled to
reduce player Compensation in such Salary Cap Year or any
subsequent Salary Cap Year so as to recover any amounts in
excess of the Aggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount.
(j) Amnesty Procedures.
(1) A Team may designate an Amnesty Player by providing
written notice of such designation to the NBA during an Amnesty
Designation Period. The "Amnesty Designation Periods" are:(i) With respect to the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year, the period
from December 9, 2011 through December 16, 2011;
(ii) With respect to the 2012-13 through 2015-16 Salary Cap
Years, the seven (7)-day period beginning on the day
following the last day of the Moratorium Period for each
such Salary Cap Year.
For players described in Section 12(f)(5)(i) above, the Team's
designation of the Amnesty Player must be accompanied by a
request for waivers on such player, and the player's Salary shall be
excluded from the Team's Team Salary immediately upon such
request for waivers. For players described in Section 12(f)(5)(ii)
above, the player's Salary shall be excluded from the Team's Team
Salary immediately upon the designation of the Amnesty Player.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a
Team may not re-sign or re-acquire an Amnesty Player prior to
the end of the last Season of the player's Contract (including any
unprotected years or Option Year) under which Salary was
excluded from such Team's Team Salary pursuant to Section
12(f)(5) above.
(3) Upon the waiver of an Amnesty Player described in Section
12(f)(5)(i) above, the following "Amnesty Waiver Procedure" shall
apply:
(i) The waiver period shall be the same as the period for other
non-amnesty waivers.
(ii) Any Team other than the Team requesting the waiver may
submit either a Full Waiver Claim or a Partial Waiver Claim
for the player. A "Full Waiver Claim" is a claim for the full
value of the remaining term of the Contract pursuant to
Section 5 of the NBA By-Laws. A "Partial Waiver Claim"
is a discount bid of a single dollar amount (rounded to the
nearest dollar) for a portion of the value of the remaining
term of the Contract. A Partial Waiver Claim can be for
any amount equal to or greater than the total of the
applicable Minimum Player Salary for all of the Remaining
Protected Years (as defined below) of the Contract and lessthan the total of the full Base Compensation provided for
in all of the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract,
provided that a Partial Waiver Claim may never be less
than the total of the unprotected Base Compensation
provided for in all of the Remaining Protected Years of the
Contract. A "Remaining Protected Year" means any
remaining year of the Contract that contains any amount of
Base Compensation protection that is not contingent on
some event occurring on a date after the request for
waivers; any remaining years of the Contract that are not
Remaining Protected Years shall hereinafter be referred to
as "Remaining Unprotected Years."
(iii) In order to submit a Partial Waiver Claim, the Team must
have a Team Salary below the Salary Cap and room equal
to at least the portion of the Claiming Team Base
Compensation Obligation (as defined in subsection (vi)(A)
below) plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to the first Year
of the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, "room" includes room
that can be unilaterally created by the claiming Team (e.g.,
via renouncements or waivers, but not via trades) and such
room must be created immediately upon the awarding of
the player pursuant to the Amnesty Waiver Procedure.
(iv) If at least one (1) Full Waiver Claim is submitted during the
waiver period, the Contract shall be awarded to the Team
submitting a Full Waiver Claim that is entitled to the
highest order of preference in accordance with the waiver
procedures set forth in the NBA Constitution and By-
Laws. If no Full Waiver Claim is submitted and at least
one (1) Partial Waiver Claim is submitted, the Contract
shall be awarded to the Team submitting the highest Partial
Waiver Claim in total dollars (or, if more than one (1)
Team submits the highest Partial Waiver Claim in total
dollars, to the Team submitting the highest Partial Waiver
Claim in total dollars that is entitled to the highest order of
preference in accordance with the waiver procedures set
forth in the NBA Constitution and By-Laws).(v) If there is no Full Waiver Claim or Partial Waiver Claim
submitted for the Contract during the waiver period, the
Contract shall be terminated.
(vi) In the event that the Contract is awarded to a Team (the
"Claiming Team") as the result of a Partial Waiver Claim:
(A) The Claiming Team shall be responsible for
payment of the player's Base Compensation in an
amount equal to the total dollar amount of the
Partial Waiver Claim allocated over the Remaining
Protected Years of the Contract in proportion to
the Base Compensation amounts provided for in
each Remaining Protected Year of the Contract
(e.g., if the player has two (2) years remaining on his
Contract with a \$10 million fully-protected Base
Compensation in year one and an \$11 million fifty
percent (50%) protected Base Compensation in
year two and the winning Partial Waiver Claim was
for \$6 million, the Claiming Team shall be
responsible for \$2.86 million of the player's Base
Compensation in year one and \$3.14 million in year
two) (the "Claiming Team Base Compensation
Obligation"). The waiving team shall be
responsible for paying the total Base Compensation
in each Remaining Protected Year of the Contract
less the Claiming Team Base Compensation
Obligation for each Remaining Protected Year of
the Contract (the "Waiving Team Base
Compensation Obligation"). In addition to the
Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation, the
Claiming Team shall also be responsible for the
total amount of all other non Base Compensation
obligations contained in the Contract (including,
but not limited to, the full amount of all Incentive
Compensation) and the total Base Compensation
for any Remaining Unprotected Year.
(B) The Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation
plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to each
Remaining Protected Year of the Contract and thetotal Base Compensation plus any Likely Bonuses
of any Remaining Unprotected Year shall be
included in the Team Salary of the Claiming Team
immediately upon the awarding of the player to the
Claiming Team pursuant to the Amnesty Waiver
Procedure.
(C) The Claiming Team may not trade a player awarded
as a result of a Partial Waiver Claim until the July 1
following the Amnesty Designation Period during
which the player was waived. If a Claiming Team
trades a player awarded as a result of a Partial
Waiver Claim (after the waiting period set forth in
the preceding sentence), the acquiring Team must
have room (or a Traded Player Exception in
accordance with the rules set forth in Section 6(j)
above) in an amount equal to at least the Claiming
Team Base Compensation Obligation plus any
Likely Bonuses applicable to the then-current Salary
Cap Year.
(D) The Claiming Team shall be responsible for making
all payments to the player (and paying all related
payroll taxes) other than Compensation due with
respect to any Season prior to the waiver. The
waiving team shall reimburse the Claiming Team
for the portion of the Waiving Team Base
Compensation Obligation applicable to each pay
period on or before each applicable pay date.
(vii) In the event that the Contract is awarded to the Claiming
Team as a result of a Partial Waiver Claim and the Claiming
Team subsequently waives the player (a "Subsequent
Waiver") resulting in the termination of the Contract:
(A) Without taking into consideration any conditional
Base Compensation protection triggered after the
date of the initial request for waivers but before the
Subsequent Waiver (hereinafter referred to as
"Triggered Base Compensation Protection"), if the
Contract contains full Base Compensationprotection in each of the Remaining Protected
Years or if the Contract contains no Remaining
Protected Years, the Claiming Team Base
Compensation Obligation and the Waiving Team
Base Compensation Obligation shall remain
unchanged.
(B) Without taking into consideration any Triggered
Base Compensation Protection, if the Contract
contains partial protection in one (1) or more of the
Remaining Protected Years, the Claiming Team
Base Compensation Obligation and Waiving Team
Base Compensation Obligation for each such year
shall be adjusted as follows upon the termination of
the Contract:
(1) The Claiming Team Base Compensation
Obligation for any Remaining Protected
Year that contains only partial Base
Compensation protection shall be reduced
by a number equal to the Claiming Team
Base Compensation Obligation for that
year, divided by the total Base
Compensation obligation for that year,
multiplied by the unprotected Base
Compensation remaining to be paid that
year (the "Adjusted Claiming Team Base
Compensation Obligation").
(2) The Waiving Team Base Compensation
Obligation for any Remaining Protected
Year that contains only partial Base
Compensation protection shall be reduced
by a number equal to the Waiving Team
Base Compensation Obligation for that
year, divided by the total Base
Compensation obligation for that year,
multiplied by the unprotected Base
Compensation remaining to be paid for that
year.(C) The full amount of any Triggered Base
Compensation Protection shall be added to the
Adjusted Claiming Team Base Compensation
Obligation in each remaining year of Contract that
contains Triggered Base Compensation Protection.
(viii) In the event that the Contract is awarded to a Team as a
result of a Subsequent Waiver, the Team that is awarded
the Contract becomes the Claiming Team for the purposes
of this Section 12(j) (and, accordingly, must have room (or
a Traded Player Exception) in an amount equal to at least
the Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation plus
any Likely Bonuses applicable to the then-current Salary
Cap Year).
