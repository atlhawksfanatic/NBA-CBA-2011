ARTICLE II
UNIFORM PLAYER CONTRACT
Section 1. Required Form.
The Player Contract to be entered into by each player and the Team by
which he is employed shall be a Uniform Player Contract in the form
annexed hereto as Exhibit A.
Section 2. Limitation on Amendments.
(a) Except as provided in Sections 3, 6, 7(d), 9, 10 and 11 of this
Article, and in Article VII, Section 7 (Extensions, Renegotiations and
Other Amendments) or Article XII (Option Clauses), no amendments to
the form of Uniform Player Contract provided for by Section 1 of this
Article shall be permitted.
(b) If a Team and a player enter into (i) a Uniform Player Contract
containing an amendment not specifically permitted by this Agreement or
(ii) a subsequent amendment to an existing Player Contract where such
amendment is not specifically permitted by this Agreement, then such
Contract or subsequent amendment, as the case may be, shall be
disapproved by the Commissioner and, consequently, rendered null and
void.
Section 3. Allowable Amendments.
In their individual contract negotiations, a player and a Team may
amend the provisions of a Uniform Player Contract, but only in the
following respects:
(a) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a
Uniform Player Contract) setting forth the Compensation to be paid or
amounts to be loaned to the player for each Season of the Contract for
rendering the services and performing the obligations described in such
Contract.
(b) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a
Uniform Player Contract) setting forth lump sum bonuses, and thepayment date for each such bonus, to be paid as a result of: (i) the
player's execution of a Uniform Player Contract or Extension (a "signing
bonus"); (ii) the player's achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating
to his performance as a player or the Team's performance during a
particular NBA Season, subject to the limitations imposed by
paragraph 3(c) of the Uniform Player Contract and Section 11(c) below; or
(iii) the player's achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to his
physical condition or academic achievement (e.g., earning a college degree
or completion of a certified leadership training program), including the
player's attendance at and participation in an off-season summer league
and/or an off-season skill and/or conditioning program upon terms and
conditions agreed upon by the Team and player (subject to the provisions
of Section 11(b) below). Any amendment agreed upon pursuant to
subsections (ii) or (iii) of this Section 3(b) must be structured so as to
provide an incentive for positive achievement by the player and/or the
Team; and any amendment agreed upon pursuant to subsection (ii) must
be based upon specific numerical benchmarks or Generally Recognized
League Honors. By way of example and not limitation, an amendment
agreed upon pursuant to Section 3(b)(ii) may provide for the player to
receive a bonus if his free-throw percentage exceeds eighty percent (80%),
but may not provide for the player to receive a bonus if his free-throw
percentage improves over his previous Season's percentage.
(c) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a
Uniform Player Contract) with respect to extra promotional appearances
to be performed by the player (in addition to those required by
paragraph 13 of such Contract) and the Compensation therefor.
(d) By agreeing upon a Compensation payment schedule (to be set
forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) different from that
provided for by paragraph 3(a) of the Uniform Player Contract; provided,
however, that such amendment shall comply with the provisions of
Section 3(b) above (relating to lump sum bonus payments) and Section
12(e) below and, provided, further that: (i) the only such amendment that
shall be permitted with respect to any Season in which the player's
Compensation is not greater than the Minimum Player Salary shall be as
described in Section 6(h) below; and (ii) with respect to Player Contracts
entered into or extended on or after the date of this Agreement (but in the
case of Extensions only with respect to the extended term), the only such
amendments that shall be permitted with respect to any Season in whichthe player's Compensation is greater than the Minimum Player Salary shall
be as follows: (y) a Uniform Player Contract may provide for the player's
Compensation (other than advances pursuant to clause (z) below and
amounts paid on a deferred basis in accordance with Article XXV of this
Agreement) to be paid in either twelve (12) equal semi-monthly payments
or thirty-six (36) equal semi-monthly payments beginning with the first of
said payments on November 15 of each year covered by the Contract and
continuing with such payments on the first and fifteenth of each month
until said Compensation is paid in full; and (z) a Uniform Player Contract
that, at the time the Contract is signed, is fully or partially protected for
lack of skill and injury or illness for a Season may provide for the player to
be paid a portion of his Compensation for such Season, up to the
Maximum Advance Amount as defined below, prior to November 15 of
such Season. The Maximum Advance Amount for a Season shall equal the
lesser of eighty percent (80%) of the amount of the player's Compensation
for such Season that is protected for lack of skill and injury or illness, or
fifty percent (50%) of the player's Base Compensation for such Season;
provided that no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the player's Base
Compensation for such Season may be paid to the player prior to the
October 1 immediately preceding the first day of the Regular Season.
(e) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 2 to a
Uniform Player Contract) stating that the Base Compensation provided for
by a Uniform Player Contract (as described in Exhibit 1 to such Contract)
shall be, in whole or in part, and subject to any conditions or limitations,
protected (as provided for by, and in accordance with the definitions set
forth in, Section 4 below) in the event that such Contract is terminated by
the Team by reason of the player's:
(i) lack of skill;
(ii) death not covered by an insurance policy procured by a
Team for the player's benefit ("death");
(iii) disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball resulting from
a basketball-related injury not covered by an insurance policy
procured by a Team for the player's benefit ("basketball-
related injury"), or disability or unfitness to play skilled
basketball resulting from any injury or illness not covered by
an insurance policy procured by a Team for the player'sbenefit ("injury or illness"), provided that a Contract can
contain protection in only one of the two categories set forth
in this Section 3(e)(iii); and/or
(iv) mental disability not covered by an insurance policy procured
by a Team for the player's benefit ("mental disability").
(f) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 3 to a
Uniform Player Contract) limiting or eliminating the player's right to
receive his Base Compensation (in accordance with paragraphs 7(c),
16(a)(iii), and 16(b) of the Uniform Player Contract) when the player's
disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball is caused by the re-injury of
one or more injuries sustained prior to, or by the aggravation of one or
more conditions that existed prior to, the execution of the Uniform Player
Contract providing for such Base Compensation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended after
the date of this Agreement (but in the case of Extensions only with respect
to the extended term), the provisions set forth in Exhibit 3 to a Uniform
Player Contract shall not apply for a Season in the event such Contract is
terminated during the period from the February 1 of such Season through
the end of that Season.

Uniform Player Contract) (i) entitling a player to earn Compensation if
such player's Uniform Player Contract is traded to another NBA team, or
(ii) prohibiting or limiting the Team's right to trade such player's Contract

provisions of Article XXIV.
(h) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 5 to a
Uniform Player Contract) permitting the player to participate or engage in
some or all of the activities otherwise prohibited by paragraph 12 of the
Uniform Player Contract; provided, however, that no amendment to
paragraph 12 of the Uniform Player Contract shall permit a player to
participate in any public game or public exhibition of basketball not
approved in accordance with Article XXIII of this Agreement.
(i) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 6 to a
Uniform Player Contract) establishing that the player must report for andsubmit to a physical examination to be performed by a physician
designated by the Team, subject to the provisions of Section 12(h) below.
(j) By agreeing to delete paragraph 7(b) of the Uniform Player
Contract in its entirety and substituting therefor the provision set forth in
Exhibit 7 to a Uniform Player Contract.

first sentence of paragraph 13(b) of such Contract.
(l) By agreeing upon provisions for the purpose of terminating an
already-existing Uniform Player Contract prior to the expiration of its
stated term, stating as follows: (i) the Team will request waivers on the
player in accordance with paragraph 16 of the Contract immediately
following the Commissioner's approval of such amendment; and
(ii) should the player clear waivers and his Contract thereupon be
terminated (x) the amount of any Compensation protection contained in
the Contract will immediately be reduced or eliminated, (y) with respect to
Player Contracts entered into or extended prior to the date of this
Agreement (but in the case of Player Contracts entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement that are extended on or after the date of this
Agreement, only with respect to the years remaining on the Contract as of
the date of this Agreement), as a result of the termination of the Contract,
the payment schedule for any Compensation remaining to be paid will be
accelerated over a shorter period or stretched over a longer period (subject,
however, to Sections 12(e) and 12(f) below), and/or (z) the Team's right of
set-off under Article XXVII of this Agreement will be modified or
eliminated.
(m) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 8 to a
Uniform Player Contract) stating that the Contract will be traded to
another team within forty-eight (48) hours of its execution or amendment,
such trade and the consummation of such trade to be conditions precedent
to the validity of the Contract or an amendment thereto; provided,
however, that any such sign-and-trade transaction must comply with
Article VII, Section 8(e).
(n) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 9 to a
Uniform Player Contract) eliminating the player's right to receive his BaseCompensation (in accordance with paragraphs 7(c), 16(a)(iii), and 16(b) of
the Uniform Player Contract) in the event the Contract is terminated prior
to the first day of the Regular Season covered by such Contract; provided,
however, that such amendment shall be permitted only if: (i) the Contract
is for one (1) Season in length, provides for the Minimum Player Salary
(with no bonuses of any kind) and does not provide for Compensation
protection of any kind pursuant to Section 3(e) above (a "Non-
Guaranteed, Training Camp Contract"); (ii) at the time of signing the Non-
Guaranteed, Training Camp Contract, the Team has no less than fourteen
(14) players signed to Player Contracts (not including any player signed to a

current) Season; and (iii) no Team may be a party at any one time to more

the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract in the
event such Contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to
paragraph 16(a)(iii) thereof, by reason of the player's lack of skill, such
agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or limitations set
forth in Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract or expressly set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs
16(a)(iii), 16(d), 16(e), and 16(g) of such Contract, the termination of such
Contract by the Team on account of the player's failure to exhibit
sufficient skill or competitive ability shall in no way affect the player's right
to receive, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation payable pursuant to
Exhibit 1 to such Contract in the amounts and at the times called for by
such Exhibit.
(b) Death. When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the
Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract in the
event such Contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to
paragraph 16(a)(iv) thereof, by reason of the player's failure to render his
services thereunder, if such failure has been caused by the player's death,
such agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or limitations set
forth in this Section 4(b), Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract, or
expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, notwithstanding the
provisions of paragraphs 16(a)(iii), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d), 16(e), and 16(g) ofsuch Contract, the termination of such Contract by the Team shall in no
way affect the player's (or his estate's or duly appointed beneficiary's) right
to receive, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation payable pursuant to
Exhibit 1 to such Contract in the amounts and at the times called for by
such Exhibit; provided, however, that: (i) such death does not result from
the player's participation in activities prohibited by paragraph 12 of the
Uniform Player Contract (as such paragraph may be modified by Exhibit 5
to the Player Contract), suicide, the abuse of alcohol, or the use of any
Prohibited Substance or controlled substance; (ii) at the time of the
player's failure to render playing services, the player is not in material
breach of such Contract; (iii) if the Team, for its own benefit, seeks to
procure an insurance policy covering the player's death, the player
cooperates with the Team in procuring such an insurance policy, including
by, among other things, supplying all information requested of him,
completing application forms, or otherwise, and submitting to all
examinations and tests requested of him by or on behalf of the insurance
company in connection with the Team's efforts to procure such policy;
and (iv) if the Team, for its own benefit, has procured such an insurance
policy, the player's estate and/or duly appointed beneficiary cooperates (in
the manner described above) with the Team and insurance company in the
processing of the Team's claim under such policy.
(c) Basketball-Related Injury. When a Team agrees to protect, in
whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player
Contract in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant
to paragraph 16(a)(iv) thereof, by reason of the player's failure to render
his services thereunder, if such failure has been caused by the player's
disability and/or unfitness to play skilled basketball as a direct result of an
injury sustained while participating in any basketball practice or game
played for the Team, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any
conditions or limitations set forth in this Section 4(c), Exhibit 2 to the
Uniform Player Contract, or expressly set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 7(b), 7(c),
16(a)(iii), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d), and 16(g) of such Contract, the termination of
such Contract by the Team shall in no way affect the player's right to
receive, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation payable pursuant to
Exhibit 1 to such Contract in the amounts and at the times called for by
such Exhibit; provided, however, that: (i) such injury does not result from
an attempted suicide, the abuse of alcohol, or the use of any Prohibited
Substance or controlled substance; (ii) at the time of the player'stermination, the player is not in material breach of such Contract; (iii) if the
Team, for its own benefit, seeks to procure an insurance policy covering

information requested of him, completing application forms, or otherwise
and submitting to all examinations and tests requested of him by or on
behalf of the insurance company in connection with the Team's efforts to
procure such policy; and (iv) if the Team, for its own benefit, has procured
such an insurance policy, the player cooperates (in the manner described
above) with the Team and the insurance company in the processing of the
Team's claim under such policy.
(d) Injury or Illness. When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in
part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract in
the event such contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to paragraph
16(a)(iv) thereof, by reason of the player's failure to render his services
thereunder, if such failure has been caused by an injury, illness, or disability
suffered or sustained by the player, such agreement shall mean that, subject
to any conditions or limitations set forth in this Section 4(d), Exhibit 2 to
the Uniform Player Contract, or expressly set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 7(b), 7(c),
16(a)(iii), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d), and 16(g) of such Contract, the termination of
such Contract by the Team shall in no way affect the player's right to
receive, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation payable pursuant to
Exhibit 1 to such Contract in the amounts and at the times called for by
such Exhibit; provided, however, that: (i) such injury, illness, or disability
does not result from the player's participation in activities prohibited by
paragraph 12 of the Uniform Player Contract (as such paragraph may be
modified in Exhibit 5 to the Player Contract), attempted suicide, the abuse
of alcohol, or the use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled substance;
(ii) at the time of such injury, illness, or disability the player is not in
material breach of such Contract; (iii) if the Team, for its own benefit,
seeks to procure an insurance policy covering the player's injury and/or
illness, the player cooperates with the Team in procuring such an insurance
policy, including by, among other things, supplying all information
requested of him, completing application forms, or otherwise and
submitting to all examinations and tests requested of him by or on behalf
of the insurance company in connection with the Team's efforts to
procure such policy; and (iv) if the Team, for its own benefit, has procured
such an insurance policy, the player cooperates (in the manner describedabove) with the Team and insurance company in the processing of the
Team's claim under such policy.
(e) Mental Disability. When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or
in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract
in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to
paragraph 16(a)(iv) thereof, by reason of the player's failure to render his
services thereunder, if such failure has been caused by the player's mental
disability, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or
limitations set forth in this Section 4(e), Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player
Contract, or expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement,
notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 16(a)(iii), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d),
16(e), and 16(g) of such Contract, the termination of such Contract by the
Team shall in no way affect the player's (or his duly appointed legal
representative's) right to receive, in whole or in part, the Base
Compensation payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 to such Contract in the
amounts and at the times called for by such Exhibit; provided, however,
that: (i) such mental disability does not result from the player's attempted
suicide, or the use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled substance;
(ii) at the time of the player's failure to render playing services, the player is
not in material breach of such Contract; (iii) if the Team, for its own
benefit, seeks to procure an insurance policy covering the player's mental
disability, the player (and/or his duly appointed legal representative)
cooperates with the Team in procuring such an insurance policy, including
by, among other things, supplying all information requested of him,
completing application forms, or otherwise and submitting to all
examinations and tests requested of him by the insurance company in
connection with the Team's efforts to procure such policy; and (iv) if the
Team, for its own benefit, has procured such an insurance policy, the
player (and/or his duly appointed legal representative) cooperates (in the
manner described above) with the Team and insurance company in the
processing of the Team's claim under such policy.
(f) No agreement by a Team to protect, in whole or in part, the Base
Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract shall require (or
be construed as requiring) such Team to continue to employ the player
(whether on the Active List, Inactive List, or otherwise); nor shall any such
agreement afford the player any right to be employed, or to be deemed as
having been employed, by such Team for any purpose.(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a
Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation
provided for by a Uniform Player Contract, and such protection is
contingent on the satisfaction of a condition expressly set forth in Exhibit
2 to that Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective only if
the Player Contract has not previously been terminated at the time such
condition is satisfied.
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a
Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation
provided for in any Option Year in favor of the Team included in a
Uniform Player Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective
only if the option to extend the term provided for in the Contract was
exercised by the Team prior to the termination of the Contract. When a
Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation
provided for in any Option Year in favor of the player, the applicability of
such protection in the circumstance where the Option has not been
exercised by the player shall be governed by the provisions of Article XII,
Section 2(a).
(i) During the term of a Player Contract, the percentage of protected
Base Compensation for any future Season shall not exceed the percentage
of unearned protected Base Compensation for any prior Season. Thus, for
example, a Team could not provide for fifty percent (50%) Base
Compensation protection in the first Season of a Player Contract and one
hundred percent (100%) Base Compensation protection in the second
Season of the Contract. However, the foregoing rule does not prevent a
Team from providing a percentage of Base Compensation protection in a
future Season that is higher than in a prior Season if the higher level of
Base Compensation for the future Season is conditional and the condition
cannot be satisfied until the completion of the prior Season. For example,
it is permissible for a Contract to provide that Base Compensation
protection for the first Season of a Player Contract equals fifty percent
(50%) and Base Compensation protection for the second Season will be
increased from fifty percent (50%) to one hundred percent (100%) if the
player is on the Team's roster as of the August 1 prior to the second
Season of the Player Contract.
(j) With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended on or
after the date of this Agreement (other than Player Contracts that providein any Season for the player to earn Compensation not greater than his
applicable Minimum Player Salary):
(i) The maximum amount of aggregate Base Compensation that
can be protected for death is thirty million dollars
(\$30,000,000).
(ii) If a player elects to purchase term life insurance for his
benefit, his Team shall be permitted to reimburse him each
Season for the premiums paid for such insurance with
respect to such Season and any other future Season(s);
provided, however, that (A) the amount of coverage for
which premiums are reimbursed by the Team in any Season
shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount of the
player's unearned Base Compensation for such Season and
each remaining Season (excluding an Option Year if not yet
exercised) that is not protected for death, and (y) forty
million dollars (\$40,000,000) and (B) any such premium
reimbursement shall not exceed the cost for 10-year
guaranteed term coverage at preferred rates.
(iii) If a Contract contains death protection covering ten million
dollars (\$10,000,000) or more of Base Compensation, the
player shall be precluded from purchasing life insurance for a
period of ninety (90) days following the execution of the
Contract or until such earlier time as the Team notifies the
player in writing that it is no longer attempting to purchase
life insurance coverage on the player (up to the amount of
the player's Base Compensation protection for death) for the
Team's benefit. During such ninety (90) day period or until
such time as the Team issues the foregoing written
notification to the player, the Team's efforts to purchase life
insurance on the player for the Team's benefit shall be
conducted diligently and in good faith.
(k) With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended on or
after the date of this Agreement, in the event that a Team terminates such
a Player Contract (resulting in the player's separation of service from the
Team), and the Team is obligated thereafter to make payments to the
player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract, such payments shall berescheduled as follows: (i) if the request for waivers on the player is made
during the period from September 1 through the following June 30, then
(x) the Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the
Contract with respect to the Salary Cap Year in which the request for
waivers is made shall be paid in accordance with the payment schedule set
forth in the Contract; and (y) the remaining Base Compensation owed to
the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract shall be aggregated and
paid in equal amounts per Season over a period equal to twice the number
of Seasons (including any Player Option Year) remaining on the Contract
following the Salary Cap Year in which the request for waivers occurred
(not including the then-current Season (or, in the case of requests for
waivers made from September 1 through the first day of a Regular Season,
the upcoming Season)), plus one Season; and (ii) if the request for waivers
on the player is made during the period from July 1 through August 31,
then the remaining Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant to
Exhibit 2 of the Contract shall be aggregated and paid in equal amounts
per Season over a period equal to twice the number of Seasons (including
any Player Option Year) remaining on the Contract following the date of
the waiver (including the upcoming Season), plus one Season. With
respect to Player Contracts extended on or after the date of this
Agreement, the foregoing payment rescheduling shall apply only with
respect to the extended term of the Player Contract. In all circumstances
described above except where specifically noted otherwise, the Base
Compensation in each Season shall be paid in accordance with the
schedule set forth in paragraph 3 of the Contract. (The following example
is for clarity. A player has four Seasons remaining on his Contract with
protected Base Compensation of the following amounts: \$4 million in
Season 1, \$4.3 million in Season 2, \$4.7 million in Season 3, and \$5 million
in Season 4. The player is waived on December 1 of Season 1. Under
Section 4(k)(i)(x) above, the player would receive the remainder of his \$4
million in Base Compensation for Season 1 in accordance with the
payment schedule set forth in his Contract. Under Section 4(k)(i)(y) above,
the \$14 million of protected Base Compensation remaining to be paid for
Seasons 2 - 4 of the Contract would be paid at a rate of \$2 million per
Season for the next seven (7) Seasons in accordance with the payment
schedule set forth in paragraph 3 of the Contract. If the same player is
instead waived on July 30 of Season 1, the \$18 million of protected Base
Compensation remaining to be paid for Seasons 1 - 4 of the Contract
would be paid -- under Section 4(k)(ii) above -- at a rate of \$2 million perSeason for the next nine (9) Seasons in accordance with the payment
schedule set forth in paragraph 3 of the Contract.)
(l) Notwithstanding that a Team and a player are authorized under
Article II, Section 4(a)-(e) to negotiate additional conditions or limitations
applicable to the player's Compensation protection for such categories as
the Team and player agree to protect, no Player Contract entered into on
or after the date of this Agreement may contain an additional condition or
limitation relating to the player's use, possession, or distribution of any
substance covered under the NBA Anti-Drug Program set forth in
Article XXXIII.
Section 5. Conformity.
(a) All currently effective Player Contracts, and all Player Contracts
entered into following the execution of this Agreement that do not
otherwise so provide, shall be deemed amended in such manner to require
the parties to comply with all terms of this Agreement, including the terms
of the Uniform Player Contract annexed hereto as Exhibit A. All Player
Contracts shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement, which shall
supersede the terms of any Player Contract inconsistent herewith. No
Player Contract shall provide for the waiver by a player or a Team of any
benefits or the sacrifice of any rights to which the player or the Team is
entitled by virtue of a Uniform Player Contract or this Agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 5(a) above, no Player Contract entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement shall be affected by any provisions
of this Agreement expressly indicating that they apply only to Player
Contracts entered into on or after the date of this Agreement.
Section 6. Minimum Player Salary.
(a) Except with respect to 10-Day Contracts provided for in Section 9
below, and Rest-of-Season Contracts provided for in Section 10 below, no
Player Contract shall provide for a Salary of less than the applicable scale
amount contained in the Minimum Annual Salary Scale set forth as Exhibit
C hereto.(b) No 10-Day Contract or Rest-of-Season Contract (as those terms
are defined in Sections 9 and 10 below) shall provide for a Salary of less
than the Minimum Player Salary applicable to that player.
(c) In determining whether a Player Contract provides for a Salary of
no less than the Minimum Player Salary applicable to that player, the
allocation of a deemed signing bonus in respect of an "international player
payment" in excess of the Excluded International Player Payment Amount
for such Salary Cap Year as set forth in Article VII, Section 3(e) (but no
other bonuses) shall be considered as part of the Salary provided for by a
Player Contract, provided that such Player Contract makes clear that the
Salary for each Season (including the allocation of any such deemed
signing bonus) equals or exceeds the Minimum Player Salary for such
Season.
(d) On July 1 of each Salary Cap Year, any Player Contract (whether
entered into before or after the date of this Agreement) that provides for a
Salary for the upcoming Season that is less than the applicable Minimum
Player Salary shall be deemed amended to provide for the applicable
Minimum Player Salary.
(e) Nothing in this Section 6 shall alter the respective rights and
liabilities of a player and a Team, as provided for in the Uniform Player
Contract or in this Agreement, with respect to the termination of a Player
Contract.
(f) Every Contract entered into between a player and Team that is
intended to provide for Compensation equal to the Minimum Player Salary
(with no bonuses of any kind) for each Season must contain the following
sentence in Exhibit 1A of such Contract and shall be deemed amended in
the manner described in such sentence: "This Contract is intended to
provide for a Base Compensation for the ____________ Season(s) equal
to the Minimum Player Salary for such Season(s) (with no bonuses of any
kind) and shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to so provide."
(g) Every Contract entered into between a player and a Team that
covers the 2020-21 Season and one or more subsequent Seasons, and that
is intended to provide for Compensation equal to the Minimum Player
Salary (with no bonuses of any kind) for such Season(s), (i) must state in
Exhibit 1A or Exhibit 1 (as applicable) of such Contract that theCompensation for such Season(s) beyond the 2020-21 Season is the
"Minimum Player Salary," and (ii) shall comply with and be subject to the
provisions of Article II, Section 6(f) above. The player's Salary for each
such Season shall equal his then-applicable Minimum Player Salary.
(h) A Uniform Player Contract that provides in any Season for the
player to earn Compensation not greater than his applicable Minimum
Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind) that, at the time the Contract is
signed, is fully or partially protected for lack of skill and injury or illness
may be amended to provide for the player to be paid a portion of his
Compensation for such Season (the "Advance"), up to the Minimum
Player Salary Advance Limit as defined below, prior to November 15 of
such Season. The Minimum Player Salary Advance Limit for a Season
shall equal the lesser of (i) eighty percent (80%) of the amount of the
player's Compensation for such Season that is protected for lack of skill
and injury or illness, or (ii) seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the
player's Base Compensation for such Season. Any Advance paid to a
player for a Season pursuant to the foregoing must be deducted in full
from the first installment of Current Base Compensation (i.e., on
November 15) and, if necessary after reducing in full the first installment,
the second installment of Current Base Compensation (i.e., on December
1) for such Season that the player would have received pursuant to
paragraph 3(a) of the Contract had there been no such Advance. To
effectuate the requirement set forth in the preceding sentence, every such
Contract that provides for an Advance must contain the following
language (and only such language) under the "Payment Schedule" heading
in Exhibit 1A with respect to each applicable Season:
"Player's Current Base Compensation with respect to the
_________ Season(s) shall be paid in accordance with
paragraph 3(a), except that the November 15 installment of
such Current Base Compensation and, if necessary after
reducing in full the November 15 installment, the
December 1 installment of such Current Base
Compensation shall be reduced by \$[amount of Advance],
which amount shall be paid to Player in advance on [date]."Section 7. Maximum Annual Salary.

however, that (A) a First Round Pick who has four (4) Years

second round pick or undrafted player who has four (4)
Years of Service as of the June 30 following the end of the
last Season covered by his Player Contract ("5th Year Eligible

Contract is executed, or (y) one hundred five percent (105%)
of the Salary for the final Season of the player's prior

(i) for any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years
of Service, the greater of (x) twenty-five percent (25%) of the

Salary Cap in effect at the time the Renegotiation is executed,
or (y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the Salary for the

(c) The parties recognize that it may not be possible to ascertain at the
time an Extension is executed whether the Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses
called for in the first Season of the extended term will exceed the
Maximum Annual Salary set forth in this Section 7. Accordingly, and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the following rule
shall apply to an Extension entered into in accordance with Article VII,
Section 7(a) or a Rookie Scale Extension entered into in accordance with
Article VII, Section 7(b) after the date of this Agreement: if, on the day
following the last day of the Moratorium Period of the Salary Cap Year
encompassing the first Season of the extended term of such Extension, the
Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses provided for in such Season exceeds the
following amounts:
(i) for any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years
of Service, the greater of (x) twenty-five percent (25%) of the
Salary Cap in effect on the day following the last day of theMoratorium Period, or (y) one hundred five percent (105%)
of the Salary provided for in the final Season of the original
term of the Contract; provided, however, that a 5th Year
Eligible Player who signed a Rookie Scale Extension and has
met at least one of the 5th Year 30% Max Criteria shall be
eligible to receive from his Prior Team up to thirty percent
(30%) of the Salary Cap in effect on the day following the
last day of the Moratorium Period;
(ii) for any player who has completed at least seven (7) but fewer
than ten (10) Years of Service, the greater of (x) thirty
percent (30%) of the Salary Cap in effect on the day
following the last day of the Moratorium Period, or (y) one
hundred five percent (105%) of the Salary provided for in the
final Season of the original term of the Contract; or
(iii) for any player who has completed ten (10) or more Years of
Service, the greater of (x) thirty-five percent (35%) of the
Salary Cap in effect on the day following the last day of the
Moratorium Period, or (y) one hundred five percent (105%)
of the Salary provided for in the final Season of the original
term of the Contract;
then such Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses shall immediately be deemed
amended to provide for the maximum amount allowed by the applicable
subsection (c)(i), (c)(ii), or (c)(iii) set forth above. In such circumstance,
Salaries plus Unlikely Bonuses in subsequent Seasons of the extended term
shall also immediately be deemed amended to provide for increases or
decreases over the amended Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the first
Season of the extended term in accordance with Article VII, Section 5(c).
(d) A player and a Team may provide in a Rookie Scale Extension that
the player's Salary (in the first Season of the extended term) will equal "the
Maximum Annual Salary applicable to such player in the first Season of the
extended term" or:
(i) in the case of a Rookie Scale Extension for a First Round
Pick who at the time the Extension is signed has already met
at least one of the 5th Year 30% Max Criteria, the player and
Team may instead provide in the Extension that the player'sSalary (in the first Season of the extended term) will equal
"[_____]% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season
of the extended term." The percentage to be included where
brackets are indicated in the foregoing language shall equal
the percentage that is agreed upon by the Team and player,
which percentage shall in no event be less than twenty-five
percent (25%) or greater than thirty percent (30%); or
(ii) in the case of a Rookie Scale Extension for any other First
Round Pick (i.e., a First Round Pick who did not meet any of
the 5th Year 30% Max Criteria during the first three (3)
Seasons of his Rookie Scale Contract), the Team may instead
provide in the Extension that the player's Salary (in the first
Season of the extended term) will equal "25% of the Salary
Cap in effect during the first Season of the extended term, or,
if the player meets at least one of the 5th Year 30% Max
Criteria during the fourth Season of his Rookie Scale
Contract, [ ]% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first
Season of the extended term." The percentage to be
included where brackets are indicated in the foregoing
language shall equal the percentage that is agreed upon by the
Team and player, which percentage shall in no event be less
than twenty-five percent (25%) or greater than thirty percent
(30%).
The player and Team may provide in a Rookie Scale Extension that the
Salaries in any Seasons after the first Season of the extended term will be
increased or decreased based on percentages specified by the parties that
comply with Article VII, Section 5(c). In the case of a Rookie Scale
Extension entered into pursuant to (ii) above, the player and Team may
instead provide that Salaries in any Seasons after the first Season of the
extended term will be increased or decreased by a different percentage
based on the percentage of the Salary Cap that the player receives in Salary
in the first Season of the extended term. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the foregoing, a Designated Player Rookie Salary Scale
Extension must provide for annual increases in Salary for each Season
following the first Season of the extended term equal to seven and one-
half percent (7.5%) of Salary for the Salary Cap Year covered by the
extended term. Any such Rookie Scale Extension (including any such
Designated Player Rookie Scale Extension) shall be deemed amended onthe day following the last day of the Moratorium Period of the Salary Cap
Year covering the first Season of the extended term to provide for specific
Salaries for each Season of the extended term, based on the Maximum
Annual Salary applicable to such player on the day following the last day of
the Moratorium Period. A Rookie Scale Extension entered into pursuant
to this subsection may not include any Incentive Compensation.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a trade
of a Uniform Player Contract would, by reason of a trade bonus contained
in such Contract, cause the player's Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the
Salary Cap Year in which such trade occurs to exceed the following
amounts:
(i) for any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years
of Service, the greater of (x) twenty-five percent (25%) of the
Salary Cap in effect at the time the trade bonus is earned, or
(y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the player's Salary for
the Season prior to the Season in which the trade bonus is
earned, or in the case of a 5th Year Eligible Player who met
at least one of the 5th Year 30% Max Criteria and signed a
Contract or Rookie Scale Extension (as applicable) that
provided for up to thirty percent (30%) of the Salary Cap,
[__]% of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the trade bonus
is earned with the applicable percentage where brackets are
indicated equal to the percentage of the Salary Cap paid to
the player in the first year of his Contract or the first year of
the extended term in the case of a Rookie Scale Extension;
(ii) for any player who has at least seven (7) but fewer than
ten (10) Years of Service, the greater of (x) thirty percent
(30%) of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the trade bonus
is earned, or (y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the
player's Salary for the Season prior to the Season in which
the trade bonus is earned; or
(iii) for any player who has completed ten (10) or more Years of
Service, the greater of (x) thirty-five percent (35%) of the
Salary Cap in effect at the time the trade bonus is earned, or
(y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the player's Salary forthe Season prior to the Season in which the trade bonus is
earned;
then such player's trade bonus shall be deemed amended to the extent
necessary to reduce the player's Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses to the
maximum amount allowed by the applicable subsection (e)(i), (e)(ii), or
(e)(iii) set forth above.
(f) For purposes of this Section 7 only, the Salary Cap shall be
calculated in accordance with Article VII, Section 2, except that the
percentage of Projected BRI to be utilized for such calculation shall be
forty-two and fourteen one hundredths percent (42.14%) for all Salary Cap
Years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Salary Cap for the 2011-12
Salary Cap Year for purposes of this Section 7 only will be \$51.689 million,
and (ii) the Salary Cap for the 2012-13 Salary Cap Year for purposes of this
Section 7 only will equal the greater of (x) the Salary Cap as calculated
pursuant to this Section 7(f), and (y) \$54.675 million.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
Contract or Rookie Scale Extension entered into between a 5th Year
Eligible Player and a Team that provides for Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses
in the first Season covered by the Contract or Rookie Scale Extension
greater than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Salary Cap in effect during
the first Season of the Contract or extended term (as applicable) in
accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 7 must be for at least
four (4) Seasons (excluding any Option Year) and, in the case of a Rookie
Scale Extension, excluding the last Season covered by the player's Rookie
Scale Contract.

preceding sentence, with respect to any year during which a
player makes at least eight (8) appearances pursuant to this
Section 8(a)(i), for each subsequent appearance made by the
player for a commercial sponsor of the Team during such
year, the player shall receive compensation from the Team by
which he is employed of at least \$4,000 (or, commencing
with the 2017-18 Salary Cap Year, \$4,500).

however, that no player shall be required to participate in
more than four (4) such activities per Season.
(b) Upon request by the Team, the NBA, or a League-related entity,
and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below, the Player
shall wear a wireless microphone during any game or practice, including
warm-up periods and going to and from the locker room to the playing
floor. The rights in any audio captured by such microphone shall belong
to the NBA or a League-related entity and may be used in any manner for
publicity or promotional purposes.
(i) The NBA or a League-related entity will be responsible for
providing the audio equipment and for the placement of the
microphone on the player in a location and manner that
minimizes interference with the player's performance.(ii) The audio captured by the wireless microphone worn by the
player ("Player Audio") will be screened and approved prior
to airing by the telecast producer and an NBA representative,
and no such audio will be aired live without the prior consent
of the player.
(iii) The NBA will use best efforts to ensure that a game telecast
will not include any Player Audio that contains profanity or
that could reasonably be considered prejudicial or
detrimental to the player or other players.
(iv) All audio tapes containing Player Audio will be returned by
the telecaster to the NBA and archived.
(v) At the request of the player or the Players Association, the
NBA shall make available a copy of the Player Audio.
(vi) In the event a player believes that any Player Audio excerpt
would be prejudicial or detrimental to him if replayed in any
non-game programming (e.g., home videos) or other publicity
or promotional content, and notifies the NBA to that effect
in writing within one hundred twenty (120) hours of the
recording of such audio, then neither the NBA nor any
League-related entity, following receipt of such notice from
the player, shall incorporate, or license others to incorporate,
such excerpt into any such content.
(vii) No player, without his consent, may be required to wear a
wireless microphone (A) for nationally-televised games, more

encompassing three (3) games played by such Team (a "10-Day
Contract").
(b) The Salary provided for by a 10-Day Contract shall not be less than
the Minimum Player Salary.
(c) No Team may enter into a 10-Day Contract with the same player
more than twice during the course of any one Season. No Team may be a
party at any one time to more 10-Day Contracts than the number of
players on such Team's Inactive List, except that if the Team has thirteen
(13) players on its Active List then the Team may be a party to a maximum
number of 10-Day Contracts equal to the number of players on such
Team's Inactive List plus one (1). For example, if a Team has thirteen (13)
players on its Active List and no players on its Inactive List, then the Team
may have one player under a 10-Day Contract. If a Team has thirteen (13)
players on its Active List and two (2) players on its Inactive List, then the
team may have three (3) players under a 10-Day Contract. If a Team has
twelve (12) players on its Active List and one (1) player on its Inactive List,
then the Team may have one (1) player under a 10-Day Contract.
(d) No Team may enter into a 10-Day Contract if the length of such
Contract, in accordance with Section 9(a), would extend to or past the date
of the Team's last Regular Season game for such Season.(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in a Uniform
Player Contract, a 10-Day Contract shall be terminated simply by
providing written notice to the player (and not by following the waiver
procedure set forth in paragraph 16 of the Uniform Player Contract) and
paying only such sums as are set forth in Exhibit 1 of such Contract.
Section 10. Rest-of-Season Contracts.
(a) At any time after the first day of an NBA Regular Season, a Team
may enter into a Player Contract that may provide Compensation to a
player only for the remainder of that Season (a "Rest-of-Season
Contract").
(b) The Salary provided for in a Rest-of-Season Contract shall not be
less than the Minimum Player Salary.
Section 11. Bonuses.
(a) (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
(A) no Uniform Player Contract entered into or extended
on or after the date of this Agreement may provide for a
signing bonus that exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the
Compensation (excluding Incentive Compensation) called
for by the Contract (or, in the case of an Extension, in the
extended term of the Extension), and (B) no Offer Sheet
may provide for a signing bonus that exceeds ten percent
(10%) of the Compensation (excluding Incentive
Compensation) called for by the Offer Sheet.
(ii) If a player's Contract provides for a signing bonus and the
player is suspended for the intentional failure or refusal to
render the services required under his Contract, the Team
shall be entitled to a return from the player of an amount
equal to the product of the signing bonus multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Regular
Season games that the player is suspended as a result of his
failure or refusal to render such services and the
denominator of which is the total number of Regular
Season games to be played by the Team during the term of
the Contract (excluding any Option Year). The foregoingshall not limit any other rights or remedies a Team may
have under the Contract or by law.
(b) (i) No Uniform Player Contract may provide for the player's
attendance at and participation in an off-season skill
and/or conditioning program that exceeds two (2) weeks in
length.
(ii) A Uniform Player Contract that contains a bonus to be
paid as a result of the player's attendance at and
participation in an off-season summer league and/or an
off-season skill and/or conditioning program in
accordance with subsection b(i) above may also contain a
provision providing that such bonus will be paid if:
(A) the Team elects in writing to waive the requirement
that the player perform the specified services; (B) the
player, in lieu of providing the specified services,
participates in training and/or plays games with his national
team during the off-season; and/or (C) the player has an
injury, illness, or other medical condition that renders the
player unable to participate in such summer league and/or
skill and conditioning program. If a Contract contains a
provision of the type described in (A) above and the Team
exercises its right to waive the requirement that the player
perform the specified services with respect to one or more
off-seasons, the amounts paid to the player shall continue
to be treated as a bonus for the player's participation in an
off-season summer league or off-season skill and/or
conditioning program and shall continue to be subject to
the rules in this Agreement relating to such bonuses.
(iii) If a Uniform Player Contract contains a bonus to be paid
as a result of the player's attendance at and participation in
an off-season summer league and/or an off-season skill
and/or conditioning program, the Team shall be required
to provide the player with a reasonable opportunity to earn
the bonus by, for example, providing the player with the
dates, times, and location(s) at which the specified services
are to be performed. A Team's failure to comply with this
requirement with respect to any off-season shall be deemedto constitute a waiver of the requirement that the player
perform the specified services for such off-season.
(iv) No Player Contract entered into or extended after the date
of this Agreement may provide for bonuses for any Season
to be paid as a result of the player's attendance at and
participation in an off-season summer league and/or an
off-season skill and/or conditioning program that exceed
twenty percent (20% ) of the player's Base Compensation
for such Season.
(c) No Uniform Player Contract entered into or extended on or after
the date of this Agreement may contain a bonus for the player being on a
Team's roster as of a specified date or for a specified duration, or for the
player dressing in uniform for or being eligible to play in a specified
number of games.
(d) If a Player Contract contains Incentive Compensation, a Team and
player shall not be permitted at any time to amend the Contract to modify
the conditions that the player must satisfy in order to earn all or any
portion of such Incentive Compensation.
Section 12. General.
(a) (i) Subject to Section 14 below, any oral or written agreement
between a player and a Team concerning terms and
conditions of employment shall be reduced to writing in
the form of a Uniform Player Contract or an amendment
thereto as soon as practicable. Immediately upon the
consummation of any such oral or written agreement, the
Team shall notify the NBA by facsimile or e-mail and
provide the NBA with all economic terms of such
agreement. Upon its receipt of an executed Uniform
Player Contract, the NBA shall provide a copy of the same
to the Players Association by fax or email within two (2)
business days.
(ii) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(i) above, neither the NBA,
any Team, nor the Players Association, or any player, shall
contend that any agreement concerning terms andconditions of employment is binding upon the player or
the Team until a Player Contract embodying such terms
and conditions has been duly executed by the parties.
Nothing herein is intended to affect (A) any authority of
the Commissioner to approve or disapprove Player
Contracts, or (B) the effect of the Commissioner's approval
or disapproval on the validity of such Player Contracts.
(iii) A violation of the first sentence of subsection (a)(i) above
may be considered evidence of a violation of Article XIII.
(b) No player shall attend the regular training camp of any Team, or
participate in games or organized practices with the Team at any time,
unless he is a party to a Player Contract then in effect. For purposes of
this Section 12(b), a player shall be considered to be a party to a Player
Contract then in effect if such Contract has been extended in accordance
with an Option permitted by this Agreement.
(c) The only form of Compensation that a Team may pay a player
under his Uniform Player Contract is cash via a check made payable to the
player or via a direct deposit made to the player's bank account.
Compensation of any other kind is prohibited.
(d) No Team shall make any direct or indirect payment of any money,
property, investments, loans, or anything else of value for fees or otherwise
to an agent, attorney, or representative of a player (for or in connection
with such person's representation of such player); nor shall any Player
Contract provide for such payment. No player shall assign or otherwise
transfer to any third party his right to receive Compensation from the
Team under his Uniform Player Contract. Nothing in this subsection (d),
however, shall prevent a Team from sending a player's regular paycheck to
a player's agent, attorney, or representative if so instructed in writing by the
player.
(e) Every Uniform Player Contract entered into or extended after the
date of this Agreement must provide that for each Season of such
Contract, the player will be paid at least twenty percent (20%) of his Salary
for such Season, excluding Likely Bonuses and any portion of the player's
Salary attributable to a trade bonus, in Current Base Compensation inaccordance with the payment schedule provided in paragraph 3 of the
Contract or in twelve (12) equal semi-monthly payments beginning with
the first of said payments on November 15 of each year covered by the
Contract and continuing with such payments on the first and fifteenth of
each month until said Compensation is paid in full.
(f) No Uniform Player Contract may provide for the payment of any
Compensation earned for a Season prior to the July 1 immediately
preceding such Season.
(g) A Team's termination of a Uniform Player Contract by reason of
the player's "lack of skill" (under paragraph 16(a)(iii) of the Uniform Player
Contract) shall be interpreted to include a termination based on the Team's
determination that, in view of the player's level of skill (in the sole opinion
of the Team), the Compensation paid (or to be paid) to the player is no
longer commensurate with the Team's financial plans or needs. The
foregoing sentence shall not affect any post-termination obligation to pay
Compensation that may result from Compensation protection provisions
included in a Uniform Player Contract.
(h) The following provisions shall govern an agreement (to be set
forth in Exhibit 6 to a Uniform Player Contract) establishing that the
player must report for and submit to a physical examination to be
performed by a physician designated by the Team:
(i) The player must report for such physical examination at the
time designated by the Team (which shall be no later than the
third business day following the execution of the Contract),
and must, upon reporting, supply all information reasonably
requested of him, provide complete and truthful answers to
all questions posed to him, and submit to all examinations
and tests requested of him. The determination of whether
the player has passed the physical examination shall be made
by the Team in its sole discretion. If the player does not pass
the physical examination, the Team shall so notify the player

in each such case:
(a) the Team shall continue to possess such rights with respect to the
player as the Team possessed at the time of the execution of the Contract,
including, without limitation, any such rights that the Team possessed
pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(b), Article X, and Article XI;
(b) any Required Tender or Qualifying Offer that was outstanding at
the time the Contract was executed shall continue in effect as if the
Contract had not been executed (including if the original deadline for
accepting the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer expired following the
execution of the Contract), but for no fewer than six (6) business days
following the Commissioner's disapproval, the Team's issuance of noticeto the player that he did not pass the physical examination, or the
rescission of such trade, as the case may be; and
(c) in the case of a player who does not pass a physical examination
pursuant to Exhibit 6: (i) the player shall not be permitted to accept such
Required Tender or Qualifying Offer for a period of two (2) business days
following his receipt of notice from the Team that he did not pass his
physical examination, during which period the Team may elect to withdraw
the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer, which shall have the
consequences described in Article X, Section 4 or Article XI, Section 4, as
the case may be; and (ii) if the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer is not
withdrawn by the Team during this period, the Required Tender or
Qualifying Offer shall thereafter be deemed amended so as to eliminate
any Exhibit 6 that may be contained therein.
