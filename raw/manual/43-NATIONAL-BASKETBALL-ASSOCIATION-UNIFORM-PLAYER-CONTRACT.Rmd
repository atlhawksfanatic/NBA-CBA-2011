whether on or off the playing floor. Subject to the provisions of the CBA,
such rules shall be part of this Contract as fully as if herein written and
shall be binding upon the Player.

this Contract, or for any conduct impairing the faithful and thorough
discharge of the duties incumbent upon the Player, the Team may
reasonably impose fines and/or suspensions on the Player in accordance
with the terms of the CBA.
(d) The Player agrees to be bound by Article 35 of the NBA
Constitution, a copy of which, as in effect on the date of this Contract, is
attached hereto. The Player acknowledges that the Commissioner is
empowered to impose fines upon and/or suspend the Player for causesand in the manner provided in such Article, provided that such fines
and/or suspensions are consistent with the terms of the CBA.
(e) The Player agrees that if the Commissioner, in his sole judgment,
shall find that the Player has bet, or has offered or attempted to bet,
money or anything of value on the outcome of any game participated in by
any team which is a member of the NBA, the Commissioner shall have the
power in his sole discretion to suspend the Player indefinitely or to expel
him as a player for any member of the NBA, and the Commissioner's
finding and decision shall be final, binding, conclusive, and unappealable.
(f) The Player agrees that he will not, during the term of this Contract,
directly or indirectly, entice, induce, or persuade, or attempt to entice,
induce, or persuade, any player or coach who is under contract to any
NBA team to enter into negotiations for or relating to his services as a
basketball player or coach, nor shall he negotiate for or contract for such
services, except with the prior written consent of such team. Breach of
this subparagraph, in addition to the remedies available to the Team, shall
be punishable by fine and/or suspension to be imposed by the
Commissioner.
(g) When the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the
NBA, he shall be given notice in writing (with a copy to the Players
Association), stating the amount of the fine or the duration of the
suspension and the reasons therefor.
6. WITHHOLDING.
(a) In the event the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or
the NBA, the Team shall withhold the amount of the fine or, in the case of
a suspension, the amount provided in Article VI of the CBA from any
Current Base Compensation due or to become due to the Player with
respect to the contract year in which the conduct resulting in the fine
and/or the suspension occurred (or a subsequent contract year if the
Player has received all Current Base Compensation due to him for the then
current contract year). If, at the time the Player is fined and/or suspended,
the Current Base Compensation remaining to be paid to the Player under
this Contract is not sufficient to cover such fine and/or suspension, then
the Player agrees promptly to pay the amount directly to the Team. In nocase shall the Player permit any such fine and/or suspension to be paid on
his behalf by anyone other than himself.
(b) Any Current Base Compensation withheld from or paid by the
Player pursuant to this paragraph 6 shall be retained by the Team or the
League, as the case may be, unless the Player contests the fine and/or
suspension by initiating a timely Grievance in accordance with the
provisions of the CBA. If such Grievance is initiated and it satisfies
Article XXXI, Section 14 of the CBA, the amount withheld from the
Player shall be placed in an interest-bearing account, pursuant to
Article XXXI, Section 10 of the CBA, pending the resolution of the
Grievance.
7. PHYSICAL CONDITION.
(a) The Player agrees to report at the time and place fixed by the Team
in good physical condition and to keep himself throughout each NBA
Season in good physical condition.
(b) If the Player, in the judgment of the Team's physician, is not in
good physical condition at the date of his first scheduled game for the
Team, or if, at the beginning of or during any Season, he fails to remain in
good physical condition (unless such condition results directly from an
injury sustained by the Player as a direct result of participating in any
basketball practice or game played for the Team during such Season), so as
to render the Player, in the judgment of the Team's physician, unfit to play
skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend such Player
until such time as, in the judgment of the Team's physician, the Player is in
sufficiently good physical condition to play skilled basketball. In the event
of such suspension, the Base Compensation payable to the Player for any
Season during such suspension shall be reduced in the same proportion as
the length of the period during which, in the judgment of the Team's
physician, the Player is unfit to play skilled basketball, bears to the length
of such Season. Nothing in this subparagraph shall authorize the Team to
suspend the Player solely because the Player is injured or ill.
(c) If, during the term of this Contract, the Player is injured as a direct
result of participating in any basketball practice or game played for the
Team, the Team will pay the Player's reasonable hospitalization and
medical expenses (including doctor's bills), provided that the hospital anddoctor are selected by the Team, that the Team shall be obligated to pay
only those expenses incurred as a direct result of medical treatment caused
solely by and relating directly to the injury sustained by the Player. Subject
to the provisions set forth in Exhibit 3, if in the judgment of the Team's
physician, the Player's injuries resulted directly from playing for the Team
and render him unfit to play skilled basketball, then, so long as such
unfitness continues, but in no event after the Player has received his full
Base Compensation for the Season in which the injury was sustained, the
Team shall pay to the Player the Base Compensation prescribed in Exhibit
1 to this Contract for such Season. The Team's obligations hereunder
shall be reduced by (i) any workers' compensation benefits, which, to the
extent permitted by law, the Player hereby assigns to the Team, and (ii) any
insurance provided for by the Team whether paid or payable to the Player.
(d) The Player agrees to provide to the Team's coach, trainer, or
physician prompt notice of any injury, illness, or medical condition
suffered by him that is likely to affect adversely the Player's ability to
render the services required under this Contract, including the time, place,
cause, and nature of such injury, illness, or condition.
(e) Should the Player suffer an injury, illness, or medical condition, he
will submit himself to a medical examination, appropriate medical
treatment by a physician designated by the Team, and such rehabilitation
activities as such physician may specify. Such examination when made at
the request of the Team shall be at its expense, unless made necessary by
some act or conduct of the Player contrary to the terms of this Contract.
(f) The Player agrees (i) to submit to a physical examination at the
commencement and conclusion of each Contract year hereunder, and at
such other times as reasonably determined by the Team to be medically
necessary, and (ii) at the commencement of this Contract, and upon the
request of the Team, to provide a complete prior medical history.
(g) The Player agrees to supply complete and truthful information in
connection with any medical examinations or requests for medical
information authorized by this Contract.
(h) A Player who consults or is treated by a physician (including a
psychiatrist) or a professional providing non-mental health related medical
services (e.g., chiropractor, physical therapist) other than a physician orother professional designated by the Team shall give notice of such
consultation or treatment to the Team and shall authorize and direct such
other physician or professional to provide the Team with all information it
may request concerning any condition that in the judgment of the Team's
physician may affect the Player's ability to play skilled basketball.
(i) If and to the extent necessary to enable or facilitate the disclosure
of medical information as provided for by this Contract or Article XXII or
XXXIII of the CBA, the Player shall execute such individual
authorization(s) as may be requested by the Team or the Medical Director
of the Anti-Drug Program or as may be required by health care providers
who examine or treat the Player.
8. PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES.
The Player acknowledges that this Contract may be terminated in
accordance with the express provisions of Article XXXIII (Anti-Drug
Program) of the CBA, and that any such termination will result in the
Player's immediate dismissal and disqualification from any employment by
the NBA and any of its teams. Notwithstanding any terms or provisions
of this Contract (including any amendments hereto), in the event of such
termination, all obligations of the Team, including obligations to pay
Compensation, shall cease, except the obligation of the Team to pay the
Player's earned Compensation (whether Current or Deferred) to the date
of termination.
9. UNIQUE SKILLS.
The Player represents and agrees that he has extraordinary and unique
skill and ability as a basketball player, that the services to be rendered by
him hereunder cannot be replaced or the loss thereof adequately
compensated for in money damages, and that any breach by the Player of
this Contract will cause irreparable injury to the Team, and to its assignees.
Therefore, it is agreed that in the event it is alleged by the Team that the
Player is playing, attempting or threatening to play, or negotiating for the
purpose of playing, during the term of this Contract, for any other person,
firm, entity, or organization, the Team and its assignees (in addition to any
other remedies that may be available to them judicially or by way of
arbitration) shall have the right to obtain from any court or arbitrator
having jurisdiction such equitable relief as may be appropriate, including adecree enjoining the Player from any further such breach of this Contract,
and enjoining the Player from playing basketball for any other person,
firm, entity, or organization during the term of this Contract. The Player
agrees that this right may be enforced by the Team or the NBA. In any
suit, action, or arbitration proceeding brought to obtain such equitable
relief, the Player does hereby waive his right, if any, to trial by jury, and
does hereby waive his right, if any, to interpose any counterclaim or set-off
for any cause whatever.
10. ASSIGNMENT.
(a) The Team shall have the right to assign this Contract to any other
NBA team, and the Player agrees to accept such assignment and to
faithfully perform and carry out this Contract with the same force and
effect as if it had been entered into by the Player with the assignee team
instead of with the Team.
(b) In the event that this Contract is assigned to any other NBA team,
all reasonable expenses incurred by the Player in moving himself and his
family to the home territory of the team to which such assignment is made,
as a result thereof, shall be paid by the assignee team.
(c) In the event that this Contract is assigned to another NBA team,
the Player shall forthwith be provided notice orally or in writing, delivered
to the Player personally or delivered or mailed to his last known address,
and the Player shall report to the assignee team within forty-eight (48)
hours after said notice has been received (if the assignment is made during
a Season), within one (1) week after said notice has been received (if the
assignment is made between Seasons), or within such longer time for
reporting as may be specified in said notice. The NBA shall also promptly
notify the Players Association of any such assignment. The Player further
agrees that, immediately upon reporting to the assignee team, he will
submit upon request to a physical examination conducted by a physician
designated by the assignee team.
(d) If the Player, without a reasonable excuse, does not report to the
team to which this Contract has been assigned within the time provided in
subsection (c) above, then (i) upon consummation of the assignment, the
Player may be disciplined by the assignee team or, if the assignment is not
consummated or is voided as a result of the Player's failure to so report, bythe assignor Team, and (ii) such conduct shall constitute conduct
prejudicial to the NBA under Article 35(d) of the NBA Constitution, and
shall therefore subject the Player to discipline from the NBA in accordance
with such Article.
11. VALIDITY AND FILING.
(a) This Contract shall be valid and binding upon the Team and the
Player immediately upon its execution.
(b) The Team agrees to file a copy of this Contract, and/or any
amendment(s) thereto, with the Commissioner of the NBA as soon as
practicable by facsimile or email and overnight mail, but in no event may
such filing be made more than forty-eight (48) hours after the execution of
this Contract and/or amendment(s).
(c) If pursuant to the NBA Constitution and By-Laws or the CBA, the
Commissioner disapproves this Contract (or amendment) within ten (10)
days after the receipt thereof in his office by overnight mail, this Contract
(or amendment) shall thereupon terminate and be of no further force or
effect and the Team and the Player shall thereupon be relieved of their
respective rights and liabilities thereunder. If the Commissioner's
disapproval is subsequently overturned in any proceeding brought under
the arbitration provisions of the CBA (including any appeals), the Contract
shall again be valid and binding upon the Team and the Player, and the
Commissioner shall be afforded another ten-day period to disapprove the
Contract (based on the Team's Room at the time the Commissioner's
disapproval is overturned) as set forth in the foregoing sentence. The
NBA will promptly inform the Players Association if the Commissioner
disapproves this Contract.
12. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES.
The Player and the Team acknowledge and agree that the Player's
participation in certain other activities may impair or destroy his ability and
skill as a basketball player, and the Player's participation in any game or
exhibition of basketball other than at the request of the Team may result in
injury to him. Accordingly, the Player agrees that he will not, without the
written consent of the Team, engage in any activity that a reasonable

of the Player, for which the Player has received written notice from the
Team prior to the execution of this Contract; or (vii) participating in any
game or exhibition of basketball, football, baseball, hockey, lacrosse, or
other team sport or competition. If the Player violates this Paragraph 12,
he shall be subject to discipline imposed by the Team and/or the
Commissioner of the NBA. Nothing contained herein shall be intended to
require the Player to obtain the written consent of the Team in order to
enable the Player to participate in, as an amateur, the sports of golf, tennis,
handball, swimming, hiking, softball, volleyball, and other similar sports
that a reasonable person would not recognize as involving or exposing the
participant to a substantial risk of bodily injury.
13. PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES.
(a) The Player agrees to allow the Team, the NBA, or any League-

the Team, the NBA or the League-related entity may designate. No matter
by whom taken, such images may be used in any manner desired by either
the Team, the NBA, or the League-related entity for publicity or
promotional purposes for Teams or the NBA. The rights in any such
images taken by the Team, the NBA, or the League-related entity shall
belong to the Team, the NBA, or the League-related entity, as their
interests may appear.
(b) The Player agrees that, during any year of this Contract, he will not
make public appearances, participate in radio or television programs,
permit his picture to be taken, write or sponsor newspaper or magazine
articles, or sponsor commercial products without the written consent of

Decision 86-2 (August 13, 1986).
(c) Upon request, the Player shall consent to and make himself
available for interviews by representatives of the media conducted at
reasonable times.

2017-18 Salary Cap Year, \$3,500) subject to Article II, Section 8 of the

manner that constitutes an unauthorized Endorsement (as such term is
defined and clarified in Article XXVIII of the CBA).
(c) The Player does not and will not contest during or after the term
of this Contract, and the Player hereby acknowledges, the exclusive rights
of the NBA, all League-related entities that generate BRI and the Teams (i)

a third party to do any of the foregoing), on a live, delayed, or archived

limited to, as part of programming or a content offering or in packaged or
other electronic or digital media. The foregoing does not confer any right
or authority to use the Player's Player Attributes in a manner that
constitutes an unauthorized Endorsement (as such term is defined and
clarified in Article XXVIII of the CBA).

In the event of an alleged default by the Team in the payments to the
Player provided for by this Contract, or in the event of an alleged failure by
the Team to perform any other material obligation that it has agreed to
perform hereunder, the Player shall notify both the Team and the League
in writing of the facts constituting such alleged default or alleged failure. If
neither the Team nor the League shall cause such alleged default or allegedfailure to be remedied within five (5) days after receipt of such written
notice, the National Basketball Players Association shall, on behalf of the
Player, have the right to request that the dispute concerning such alleged
default or alleged failure be referred immediately to the Grievance
Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of the CBA. If, as a result of
such arbitration, an award issues in favor of the Player, and if neither the
Team nor the League complies with such award within ten (10) days after
the service thereof, the Player shall have the right, by a further written
notice to the Team and the League, to terminate this Contract.

MISCONDUCT
35. The provisions of this Article 35 shall govern all Players in the
Association, hereinafter referred to as "Players."
(a) Each Member shall provide and require in every contract with any
of its Players that they shall be bound and governed by the provisions of
this Article. Each Member, at the direction of the Board of Governors or
the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall take such action as the Board
or the Commissioner may direct in order to effectuate the purposes of this
Article.
(b) The Commissioner shall direct the dismissal and perpetual
disqualification from any further association with the Association or any of
its Members, of any Player found by the Commissioner after a hearing to
have been guilty of offering, agreeing, conspiring, aiding or attempting to
cause any game of basketball to result otherwise than on its merits.
(c) If in the opinion of the Commissioner any act or conduct of a
Player at or during an Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff game has
been prejudicial to or against the best interests of the Association or the
game of basketball, the Commissioner shall impose upon such Player a
fine not exceeding \$50,000, or may order for a time the suspension of any
such Player from any connection or duties with Exhibition, Regular
Season, or Playoff games, or he may order both such fine and suspension.
(d) The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite
or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding \$50,000, or inflict
both such suspension and fine upon any Player who, in his opinion,
(i) shall have made or caused to be made any statement having, or that was
designed to have, an effect prejudicial or detrimental to the best interests
of basketball or of the Association or of a Member, or (ii) shall have been
guilty of conduct that does not conform to standards of morality or fair
play, that does not comply at all times with all federal, state, and local laws,
or that is prejudicial or detrimental to the Association.
(e) Any Player who, directly or indirectly, entices, induces, persuades
or attempts to entice, induce, or persuade any Player, Coach, Trainer,General Manager or any other person who is under contract to any other
Member of the Association to enter into negotiations for or relating to his
services or negotiates or contracts for such services shall, on being charged
with such tampering, be given an opportunity to answer such charges after
due notice and the Commissioner shall have the power to decide whether
or not the charges have been sustained; in the event his decision is that the
charges have been sustained, then the Commissioner shall have the power
to suspend such Player for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a
fine not exceeding \$50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon
any such Player.
(f) Any Player who, directly or indirectly, wagers money or anything of
value on the outcome of any game played by a Team in the league
operated by the Association shall, on being charged with such wagering, be
given an opportunity to answer such charges after due notice, and the
decision of the Commissioner shall be final, binding and conclusive and
unappealable. The penalty for such offense shall be within the absolute
and sole discretion of the Commissioner and may include a fine,
suspension, expulsion and/or perpetual disqualification from further
association with the Association or any of its Members.
(g) Except for a penalty imposed under Paragraph (f) of this
Article 35: (i) any challenge by a Team to the decisions and acts of the
Commissioner pursuant to Article 35 shall be appealable to the Board of
Governors, who shall determine such appeals in accordance with such
rules and regulations as may be adopted by the Board in its absolute and
sole discretion, and (ii) any challenge by a Player to the decisions or acts of
the Commissioner pursuant to Article 35 shall be governed by the
provisions of Article XXXI of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining
Agreement then in effect.EXCERPT FROM NBA BY-LAWS
5.01. Waiver Right. Except for sales and trading between
Members in accordance with these By-Laws, no Member shall sell, option,
or otherwise assign the contract with, right to the services of, or right to
negotiate with, a Player without complying with the waiver procedure
prescribed by this Constitution and By-Laws.
5.02. Waiver Price. The waiver price shall be \$1,000 per Player.
5.03. Waiver Procedure. A Member desiring to secure waivers on a
Player shall notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee, who
shall, on behalf of such Member, immediately notify all other Members of
the waiver request. Such Player shall be assumed to have been waived
unless a Member shall notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner's
designee in accordance with Section 5.04 of a claim to the rights to such
Player. Once a Member has notified the Commissioner or the
Commissioner's designee of its desire to secure waivers on a Player, such
notice may not be withdrawn. A Player remains the financial responsibility
of the Member placing him on waivers until the waiver period set by the
Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee has expired.
5.04. Waiver Period. If the Commissioner or the Commissioner's
designee distributes notice of request for waiver, any Members wishing to
claim rights to the Player shall do so by giving notice by telephone and in a
Writing of such claim to the Commissioner or the Commissioner's
designee within forty-eight (48) hours after the time of such notice. A
Team may not withdraw a claim to the rights to a Player on waivers.
Notwithstanding Article 40 of the NBA Constitution, Saturdays, Sundays
and legal holidays shall be included when computing the above-referenced
waiver period.
5.05. Waiver Preferences.
(a) In the event that more than one (1) Member shall have claimed the
rights to a Player placed on waivers, the claiming Member with the lowest
team standing at the time the waiver was requested shall be entitled to
acquire the rights to such Player. If the request for waiver shall occur after
the last day of the Season and before 11:59 p.m. eastern time on thefollowing November 30, the standings at the close of the previous Season
shall govern.
(b) If the winning percentage of two (2) claiming Teams are the same,
then the tie shall be determined, if possible, on the basis of the Regular
Season Games between the two (2) Teams during the Season or during the
preceding Season, as the case may be. If still tied, a toss of a coin shall
determine priority. For the purpose of determining standings, both
Conferences of the Association shall be deemed merged and a
consolidated standing shall control.
5.06. Players Acquired Through Waivers. A Member who has
acquired the rights and title to the contract of a Player through the waiver
procedure may not sell or trade such rights for a period of thirty (30) days
after the acquisition thereof; provided, however, that if the rights to such
Player were acquired between Seasons, the 30-day period described herein
shall begin on the first day of the next succeeding Season.
5.07. Additional Waiver Rules. The Commissioner or the Board of
Governors may from time to time adopt additional rules (supplementary to
those set forth in this Section 5) with respect to the operation of the
waiver procedure. Such rules shall not be inconsistent with the provisions
of this Section 5 and shall apply to but shall not be limited to the
mechanics of notice, inadvertent omission of notification to a Member,
and rules of construction as to time.AGENT CERTIFICATION

"7. (b) The Player agrees, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Contract, that he will to the best of his ability maintain himself in physical
condition sufficient to play skilled basketball at all times. If the Player, in
the reasonable judgment of the physician designated for that purpose by
the Team, is not in good physical condition at the date of his first
scheduled game for the Team, or if, at the beginning of or during any
Season, he fails to remain in good physical condition, in either event so as
to render the Player unfit in the reasonable judgment of said physician to
play skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend the Player
for successive one-week periods until the Player, in the reasonable
judgment of the Team's physician, is in good physical condition; provided,
however, that at the end of each such one-week period of suspension, if
the Team notifies the Player, orally or in writing, that in its reasonable
judgment it believes the Player is still not in good physical condition, and if
the Player so requests, then the Player shall be examined by a physician or
physicians designated for such purpose by the President, or any Vice
President if the President is not available, of the American Society of
Orthopedic Physicians, or equivalent organization (the "Reviewing
Physician"), whose sole judgment concerning the physical condition of the
Player to play skilled basketball shall be binding upon the Team and the
Player for purposes of this paragraph. The suspension of the Player shall
be terminated promptly upon the failure of the Team to give the Player the
notice required at the end of the one-week period or upon the finding of
said Reviewing Physician that the Player is in physical condition sufficient
to play skilled basketball. In the event of a suspension permitted
hereunder, the Compensation (excluding any signing bonus or IncentiveCompensation) payable to the Player for any Season during such
suspension shall be reduced in the same proportion as the length of the
period of disability so determined bears to the length of the Season.
Nothing in this paragraph 7(b) shall authorize the Team to suspend the
