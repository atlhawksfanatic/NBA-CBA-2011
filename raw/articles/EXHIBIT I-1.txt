URINE COLLECTION PROCEDURES
When the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure
that the player is positively identified through presentation of photo ID or
identification by a team representative. If the player's identity cannot be
established, the collector shall not proceed with the collection.
The player will be asked to select a sealed urine specimen cup. The
player will then provide his urine specimen under the direct observation of
the collector.
The collector shall ensure that the player has provided a urine
specimen of sufficient volume for accurate testing. If such a sample
cannot immediately be provided by the player, he shall be instructed to
remain at the testing site for a reasonable period of time until he can
provide such a specimen. Once the specimen has been obtained, the
player will select a sealed specimen kit, which contains two bottles. The
collector, in the presence of the player, will pour the specimen into two
bottles. One bottle will be used as the primary or "A" specimen and the
other will be used as the split or "B" specimen. The specimen bottles will
be sealed with tamper-proof seals in the presence of the player. The seals
will contain a unique identification number that corresponds to the
number on the chain of custody form.
The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form
(which may be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the
handling of the specimen. The collector will note any irregularities
concerning the specimen on the chain of custody form. Both the player
and collector will sign the chain of custody form. The kit will be sealed
and sent via overnight courier to the laboratory for testing. If a hard copy
chain-of-custody form is used, it will be included in the kit containing the
two specimens that is sent by overnight courier to the laboratory. If an
electronic chain-of-custody form is used, it will be sent to the laboratory
electronically.
Once the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will
be analyzed. If the primary specimen tests positive, the split sample will be
placed in frozen storage and will be available for testing by a different
laboratory, if requested by the player.EXHIBIT I-4
