ARTICLE XXIV
PROHIBITION OF NO-TRADE CONTRACTS
Section 1. General Limitation.
No Player Contract may contain any prohibition or limitation of an
NBA Team's right to assign such Contract to another NBA Team.
Section 2. Exceptions to General Limitation.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1 of this Article XXIV:
(a) A Player Contract may contain (in Exhibit 4 to such Player
Contract) a provision entitling a Player to earn Compensation if the
player's Uniform Player Contract is traded ("trade bonus") subject to the
following:
(i) A trade bonus shall be payable only the first time that the
Contract is traded; provided, however, that if a Contract is
signed in connection with an agreement to trade the
Contract in accordance with Article VII, Section 8(e) and
the Contract contains a trade bonus, the bonus shall not
apply to such initial trade but shall instead be payable only
the second time the Contract is traded.
(ii) A trade bonus shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the
Base Compensation remaining to be earned by the player
pursuant to the Contract at the time of the trade (excluding
an Option Year if not yet exercised).
(iii) The only allowable amendment to Exhibit 4 to a Uniform
Player Contract shall be the specification of the amount of
the trade bonus to be paid to the player, expressed as either
(A) a specified percentage of the Base Compensation
remaining to be earned under the Contract at the time of
the trade (excluding an Option Year if not yet exercised),
or (B) a specified dollar amount not to exceed a specified
percentage of Base Compensation remaining to be earnedunder the Contract at the time of the trade (excluding an
Option Year if not yet exercised).
(iv) A Contract that does not contain a trade bonus when
signed cannot be amended to add one, except that: (A) if
the Contract is extended (other than pursuant to an
agreement to trade the extended Contract in accordance
with Article VII, Section 8(e)), the Contract may be
amended simultaneously to provide for a trade bonus that
will be payable only the first time that the Contract is
traded following the signing of the Extension (and not as a
result of any subsequent trade), and (B) if the Contract is
extended pursuant to an agreement to trade the extended
Contract in accordance with Article VII, Section 8(e), the
Contract may be amended simultaneously to provide for a
trade bonus that shall not apply to such initial trade but
shall instead be payable only if the extended Contract is
traded a second time (and not as a result of a subsequent
trade).
(v) In no event shall a trade bonus in a Contract be payable
more than once.
(b) A Player Contract entered into by a player who has eight (8) or
more Years of Service in the NBA and who has rendered four (4) or more
Years of Service for the Team entering into such Contract may contain a
prohibition or limitation of such Team's right to trade such Contract to
another NBA Team.
