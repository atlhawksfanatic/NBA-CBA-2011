ARTICLE IV
BENEFITS
Section 1. Player Pension Benefits.
Effective with the date of this Agreement, and continuing until the
expiration or termination of this Agreement, the National Basketball
Association Players' Pension Plan, as restated effective February 2, 2009,
and as amended by the First, Second, Third and Fourth Amendments
thereto (the "Pension Plan"), shall be continued and maintained in full
force and effect. All capitalized terms used in this Section 1 not otherwise
defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Pension
Plan.
Subject to approval by the Internal Revenue Services (the "IRS") and to
the extent permitted by applicable law, and except as provided in Section
1(f) below, the NBA shall provide the following pension benefits to NBA
players and former NBA players:
(a) Current Benefit. As of the date of this Agreement, the Normal
Retirement Pension payable under Section 3.2 of the Pension Plan shall be
\$518.92 per month for each year of Credited Service payable in accordance
with the provisions of the Pension Plan.
(b) Benefit Increases. Effective for the Plan Year commencing
February 2, 2012 and for each subsequent Plan Year beginning during the
term of this Agreement, the Normal Retirement Pension payable under
Section 3.2 of the Pension Plan shall be adjusted (the monthly benefit
amount following any such adjustment, the "New Monthly Benefit"),
subject to Section 1(c) below, such that the New Monthly Benefit is equal
to the amount that results in the actuarially-determined annual
contributions to be made to the Pension Plan to fund for such New
Monthly Benefit for the applicable Plan Year to equal the sum of (i) the
actuarially-determined annual contributions to be made to the Pension
Plan to fund the "Baseline Benefit" (defined below) for such Plan Year
and (ii) \$10 million; provided, however, that in no event shall the New
Monthly Benefit for any Plan Year be less than the New Monthly Benefit
in effect for the immediately preceding Plan Year (for purposes of the
foregoing, the "New Monthly Benefit" as of the date of this Agreement is\$518.92). The "Baseline Benefit" means the Normal Retirement Pension
amount in effect under the Pension Plan prior to the additions of the
benefit increase amounts set forth in Sections 3.2(z) and 3.2A of the
Pension Plan, as adjusted for future increases in the cost-of-living in the
manner provided for in Section 415(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code").
(1) Any increase in the New Monthly Benefit after the date of this
Agreement shall be effective as of the first day of the month
following the beginning of the Plan Year of the Pension Plan to
which the increase relates (the "New Benefit Increase
Commencement Date"), shall apply only to any benefit payment or
payments to be made on or after the applicable New Benefit
Increase Commencement Date, and shall not require the
recalculation of any benefit payment or payments made prior to
the applicable New Benefit Increase Commencement Date.
(2) The amount of any New Monthly Benefit which exceeds the
Baseline Benefit (other than any death benefits payable to a
beneficiary pursuant to Article VII of the Pension Plan) shall not
be payable in any of the following forms of payment provided for
under the Pension Plan: (i) a lump sum payment; (ii) monthly
installments of a fixed amount; (iii) monthly installments for a fixed
period; and (iv) monthly installments which are temporarily
increased based upon the player's estimated social security benefit.
(c) Limitations on Benefits. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary:
(1) Neither (a) the benefits accrued or payable to any player or
player's beneficiary under the Pension Plan for a Plan Year nor
(b) the New Monthly Benefit for a Plan Year shall exceed the
maximum benefit amount permitted under the Code (and the
regulations issued thereunder) as in effect for that Plan Year (as
adjusted in accordance with the actuarial factors specified in the
Pension Plan and as in effect on the date that the benefit accrues
or commences (or is paid) or for the Plan Year for which the New
Monthly Benefit is determined), as such limits may be adjusted for
future increases in the cost-of-living in the manner provided under
Section 415(d)(2) of the Code.(2) Neither (a) the benefits accrued or payable to any player or
player's beneficiary under the Pension Plan for a Plan Year nor
(b) the New Monthly Benefit for a Plan Year shall exceed the
maximum benefit amount permitted under the Code (and the
regulations issued thereunder), as in effect for the February 2, 2010
- February 1, 2011 Plan Year, as such limits may be adjusted for
future increases in the cost-of-living in the manner prescribed by
Section 415(d)(2) of the Code.
(3) If all or any portion of the actuarially-determined annual
contributions to be made to the Pension Plan would not be fully
deductible under the Code when paid to the Pension Plan, the
New Monthly Benefit shall not exceed the amount which would
result in all of such contributions being fully deductible when paid.
The Players Association shall be given written notice of any such
determination.
(d) Pre-1965 Players. Pre-1965 Players shall continue to be entitled
to receive the Normal Retirement Benefit in the amount and on the terms
and conditions set forth in Article XX of the Pension Plan. Any benefits
that are unable to be paid to Pre-1965 Players under the Pension Plan
because of the benefit limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Code
shall be paid to such Pre-1965 Players pursuant to the National Basketball
Association Excess Benefit Plan for Pre-1965 Players (the "Pre-1965
Players Excess Benefit Plan").
(e) Pre-1965 Retirees. Pre-1965 Retirees shall continue to be entitled
to receive the Retirement Benefit in the amount and on the terms and
conditions set forth in Article XXA of the Pension Plan.
(f) Players Employed by Toronto.
(1) Players employed by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd.
(or any successor thereto) ("Toronto") or by an NBA Team
located in any other country other than the United States shall
receive pension benefits of comparable value. Players employed by
Toronto ("Toronto Players") shall continue to receive such
benefits by means of the Pension Plan and a separate pension plan
maintained by Toronto (the "Toronto Plan"); provided, however,
that a player shall not be eligible to participate (or continue toparticipate) in the Pension Plan for any period of time during
which the player is both a resident of Canada and a Toronto Player
(a "Canadian Resident"). Toronto shall provide an alternative
arrangement to the Canadian Resident, subject to Section 1(f)(2)
below.
If the participation of Toronto Players in the Pension Plan
would, at any time, result in the Pension Plan becoming subject to
Canadian Provincial Pension Legislation and/or Canadian Federal
Tax Laws (to the extent that the application of such tax laws would
result in adverse tax consequences to the Pension Plan, the NBA
Teams and/or the Toronto Players) or result in the Toronto Plan's
failure, at any future time, to either be qualified under the Code or
registered under Canadian Provincial Pension Legislation and/or
Canadian Federal Tax Laws, then any obligation to establish,
maintain and/or make contributions to the Pension Plan in respect
of Toronto Players and the Toronto Plan pursuant to this
Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining
agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such
termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other
provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of
any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement,
nor shall it create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the
term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of
pension benefits to the players, (ii) to lockout, or (iii) to strike. In
the event of such termination, Toronto shall provide an alternative
arrangement to the Toronto Players, subject to Section 1(f)(2)
below.
(2) The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon the
type(s) of alternative arrangement to be provided pursuant to this
Section 1(f) to either a Toronto Player or Canadian Resident. Such
alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined
on an after-tax basis) to Toronto equal to the annual accrual cost
that Toronto would have incurred under the Pension Plan and the
Toronto Plan.
(g) Pension Plan Tax-Qualification Status. Notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement: (1) if any change or amendment made to
the Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, asamended ("ERISA"), or to any regulations (whether final, temporary or
proposed) or rulings issued thereunder; (2) if any interpretation,
application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation, application or
enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or
by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or any regulations or rulings issued
thereunder; (3) if any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed) or
rulings issued by the IRS under the Code or ERISA; or (4) if any
provisions of this Agreement, including any of the amendments or benefit
increases to be provided under the Pension Plan pursuant to Section 1,
would result in the Pension Plan no longer being a tax-qualified plan under
Section 401(a) of the Code, or would require NBA Teams to incur costs
over and above any costs required to be incurred to implement the
provisions of this Agreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement
in order for the Pension Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status under
Section 401(a) of the Code (provided, however, that such additional costs
are incurred solely in connection with the provision of pension benefits to
their non-player employees or to non-player employees of affiliates (within
the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams),
then any obligation to maintain and/or make contributions to the Pension
Plan pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective
bargaining agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such
termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other
provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any
other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it
create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this
Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the
players, (ii) to lockout, or (iii) to strike. In the event of such termination,
the NBA Teams shall provide an alternative arrangement to the players.
The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon the type(s) of
alternative arrangement to be provided. The costs of the alternative
arrangement to be provided shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an
after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams equal to the annual accrual cost that
such Teams would have incurred under the Pension Plan to fund the
benefit described in this Section 1, commencing on the date of
termination.
(h) Amounts to be Applied Against New Benefit Amount. The
following amounts shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount
provided for by Section 8 below:(1) The greater of (A) Fifty (50) percent of the increase in the
amount of the actuarially determined annual contributions to be
made for any Plan Year to the Pension Plan to fund the difference
between (1) the New Monthly Benefit for such Plan Year (\$518.92
for the Plan Year commencing February 2, 2011) over (2) the
Baseline Benefit (the "New Benefit Cost Increase") and (B) the
New Benefit Cost Increase minus \$5 million;
(2) Fifty (50) percent of the increase in the amount of the
actuarially-determined annual contributions to be made for a Plan
Year to the Pension Plan to fund the Normal Retirement Benefits
for Pre-1965 Players described in Section 20.3(a)(v) of the Pension
Plan over the amount of the actuarially determined annual
contributions that would be required to be made for that Plan Year
to the Pension Plan in order to fund the Normal Retirement
Benefits for Pre-1965 Players described in Section 20.3(a)(iv) of the
Pension Plan had Section 20.3(a)(v) of the Pension Plan never
been in effect (the "Pre-1965 Player Cost Increase");
(3) Fifty (50) percent of the costs incurred for a Plan Year in
order to provide the excess portion of the benefit amount
described in Pension Plan Section 20.3(a)(v) under the Pre-1965
Players Excess Benefit Plan over the costs that would be incurred
for that Plan Year in order to provide for the excess portion of the
benefit amount described in Pension Plan Section 20.3(a)(iv) under
the Pre-1965 Players Excess Benefit Plan had Section 20.3(a)(v) of
the Pension Plan never been in effect (the "Pre-1965 Player Excess
Benefit Cost Increase");
(4) Fifty (50) percent of the amount of the actuarially-determined
annual contributions to be made for a Plan Year to the Pension
Plan to fund the Retirement Benefits for Pre-1965 Retirees
described in Section 20A.3(a) of the Pension Plan (the "Pre-1965
Retiree Cost Increase"); and
(5) One hundred (100) percent of the costs, including the cost of
professional fees (e.g., attorneys, accountants, actuaries and
consultants) ("Professional Fees"), incurred in connection with the
determination and implementation of any alternative benefits
pursuant to Sections 1(f) and/or 1(g).For purposes of this Section 1(h), in determining the New
Benefit Cost Increase, the Pre-1965 Player Cost Increase, the
Pre-1965 Player Excess Benefit Cost Increase, and the Pre-
1965 Retiree Cost Increase for a Plan Year, the annual
contributions relating to such cost increases (and in the case
of the Pre-1965 Player Excess Benefit Cost Increase, the costs
incurred relating to such cost increase) shall be determined
based on the law in effect for that Plan Year, taking into
account (i) any new law or change or amendment made to
ERISA, the Code and/or other applicable law, or to any
regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed), rulings or
formal guidance issued thereunder and (ii) any regulations
(whether final, temporary or proposed), rulings or formal
guidance issued under ERISA or the Code.
(i) Actuarial Determinations.
(1) The parties agree that, for each Plan Year, the determination
of the New Monthly Benefit under Section 1(b), the
determinations described in Section 1(c)(3), and the determination
of the New Benefit Cost Increase, the Pre-1965 Player Cost
Increase, the Pre-1965 Player Excess Benefit Cost Increase, and
the Pre-1965 Retiree Cost Increase under Section 1(h) shall each be
made by the actuaries of the Pension Plan, in all instances using
reasonable actuarial assumptions, factors, methods and projections.
Any such determinations shall be binding and conclusive.
(2) All relevant actuarial assumptions, factors, methods and
projections used in making the determinations described in Section
1(b) shall be the same for both determining the actuarially-
determined annual contributions that would have been made to the
Plan for a Plan Year in order to fund for the Baseline Benefit and
determining the actuarially-determined annual contributions to be
made to the Pension Plan for that Plan Year in order to fund for
the New Monthly Benefit.
Section 2. Player 401(k) Benefits.
Except as set forth below in this Section 2, and subject to approval by
the IRS, effective with the date of this Agreement, and continuing until theexpiration or termination of this Agreement, the NBA shall provide the
following 401(k) benefits to NBA players:
(a) Benefits in accordance with the NBA-NBPA 401(k) Savings Plan
as restated effective November 1, 2009, and as amended by the First and
Second Amendments thereto (the "401(k) Plan"). The 401(k) Plan shall
continue to provide for (1) deferrals by players pursuant to Section 401(k)
of the Code and (2) except as may be limited below, Team matching
contributions in respect of player deferrals for a Salary Cap Year, as
requested in writing by the Players Association. The request for the
matching contributions by the Players Association for a Season shall be
made in writing prior to the commencement of that Season. Team
matching contributions and player deferrals shall at all times be subject to
all applicable limitations under the Code, including, but not limited to, the
limitation on contributions under Code Section 415, the maximum
limitation on compensation under Code Section 401(a)(17), and the
maximum limitation on 401(k) deferrals under Code Section 402(g). The
cost of funding all matching contributions made by Teams under the
401(k) Plan (i) shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided
for by Section 8 below, and (ii) shall be limited to the portion of the New
Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to
Section 8(b)(2) below. Any matching contributions to be made to the
401(k) Plan in respect of each Season shall be made no later than thirty
(30) days following the completion of the BRI Audit Report for the Salary
Cap Year covering such Season.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total amount of the deferral
contributions to be made by players to the 401(k) Plan and the Team
matching contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan in respect of deferral
contributions made by players under the 401(k) Plan shall be limited to an
amount that, taking into account only compensation paid to current
players by the Teams, would result in all of such deferral contributions and
matching contributions being fully deductible under the Code (and, where
applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid to the 401(k) Plan. If,
for any reason, all or a portion of the deferral contributions and/or Team
matching contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan will not, when paid
to the 401(k) Plan, be fully deductible under the Code, the parties agree
that the contributions shall be reduced to result in all such contributions
being fully deductible when paid.(b) The terms of the 401(k) Plan shall continue to permit participation
by Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis under Canadian income tax
laws; provided, however, that a player shall not be eligible to participate in
the 401(k) Plan for the period of time during which the player is a
Canadian Resident. If either (1) the NBA and the Players Association
should determine that the 401(k) Plan cannot continue to be provided to
Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis under Canadian income tax laws
or (2) a Toronto Player is a Canadian Resident, Toronto shall provide an
alternative arrangement for Toronto Players or, if applicable, the Canadian
Resident, in lieu of the 401(k) Plan. The NBA and the Players Association
shall agree upon the type(s) of alternative arrangement to be provided.
The costs of the alternative arrangement to be provided shall be at an
annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to Toronto equal to the
annual cost that Toronto would have incurred under the 401(k) Plan with
respect to the Toronto matching contributions. The cost to Toronto of
providing for any such alternative arrangement (i) shall be applied against
the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, and (ii) shall be
limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available
for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(2) below.
(c) All costs, including the cost of Professional Fees, incurred in
connection with the determination and implementation of any alternative
arrangement pursuant to Section 2(b) and/or Section 2(d) shall be (1) paid
by the Teams, (2) applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for
by Section 8 below, and (3) limited to the portion of the New Benefit
Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section
8(b)(2).
(d) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement: (1) if any change
or amendment made to the Code, ERISA, or to any regulations (whether
final, temporary or proposed) or rulings issued thereunder; (2) if any
interpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation,
application or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or any regulations or
rulings issued thereunder; (3) if any regulations (whether final, temporary
or proposed) or rulings issued by the IRS under the Code or ERISA; or (4)
if any provisions of this Agreement would result in the 401(k) Plan no
longer being a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, or
would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and above any costs
required to be incurred to implement the provisions of this Agreement orany prior collective bargaining agreement in order for the 401(k) Plan to
maintain its tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the Code
(provided, however, that such additional costs are incurred solely in
connection with the provision of benefits to their non-player employees or
to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of Sections
414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation to
maintain and/or make contributions to the 401(k) Plan pursuant to this
Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall
terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair
the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the
legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective
bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (i) to unilaterally
implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the
provision of 401(k) benefits to the players, (ii) to lockout, or (iii) to strike.
In the event of such termination, the NBA Teams shall provide an
alternative arrangement to the players. The NBA and the Players
Association shall agree upon the type(s) of alternative arrangement to be
provided. The alternative arrangement to be provided shall be at an annual
cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams equal to the
annual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the 401(k) Plan
with respect to Team matching contributions commencing on the date of
termination. The cost of funding of any such alternative arrangement
(x) shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided by Section 8
below, and (y) shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount,
if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(2) below.
(e) All capitalized terms used in this Section 2 not otherwise defined in
this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the 401(k) Plan.
Section 3. Player Supplemental Medical Benefits.
Except as set forth below in this Section 3, effective with the date of
this Agreement, and continuing until the expiration or termination of this
Agreement, the NBA shall provide the following supplemental medical
benefits to NBA players:
(a) Benefits in accordance with the terms of the NBPA-NBA
Supplemental Benefit Plan as restated June 1, 2008, and as amended from
time to time (the "Supplemental Benefit Plan") and the Agreement and
Declaration of Trust of the NBPA-NBA Supplemental Benefit Plan,established July 22, 2004 (the Trust created thereunder to be referred to
hereinafter as the "SBP Trust"). The SBP Trust shall continue to be
jointly operated and administered by the NBA and Players Association in
accordance with Section 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act
of 1947, as amended, and the provisions of the SBP Trust and the
Supplemental Benefit Plan. It is intended by the NBA and Players
Association that the Supplemental Benefit Plan and SBP Trust shall
continue to constitute (1) a collectively-bargained voluntary employees'
beneficiary association ("VEBA") that qualifies as a tax exempt
organization under the provisions of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, and
(2) a health reimbursement arrangement that is administered and operated
in compliance with IRS rules applicable to such arrangements.
(b) (1) The SBP Trust and the Supplemental Benefit Plan shall
continue to be operated and administered for the purpose of
providing certain health-related benefits to players who played in
the NBA during and/or after the 2000-01 Season in accordance
with provisions set forth in the Supplemental Benefit Plan.
(2) The Supplemental Benefit Plan shall be operated and
administered in accordance with a plan document that is separate
and apart from the Summary Plan Description to be prepared
with respect to the Supplemental Benefit Plan.
(c) (1) All costs of funding the Supplemental Benefit Plan and (2) all
costs, including the cost of Professional Fees, incurred in
connection with the operation and administration of the SBP
Trust and the Supplemental Benefit Plan, and in connection with
the determination and implementation of any alternative
arrangement pursuant to Section 3(f) and/or 3(g) shall be (i) paid
by the Teams, (ii) applied against the New Benefit Amount
provided for by Section 8 below, and (iii) limited to the portion of
the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose
pursuant to Section 8(b)(7) below. Except as may otherwise be
agreed to by the NBA and the Players Association, any
contributions to fund the Supplemental Benefit Plan in respect of
each Salary Cap Year shall be made no later than ninety (90) days
following the completion of the BRI Audit Report for such Salary
Cap Year.(d) The daily operations of the Supplemental Benefit Plan shall
continue to be administered by an independent third-party administrator,
as selected by the trustees of the SBP Trust, at the administrator's office.
In the exercise of its responsibilities, the independent third-party
administrator shall be required to comply with ERISA and all other
applicable laws and to act in a manner that is consistent with the
provisions of the SBP Trust and the Supplemental Benefit Plan.
(e) The SBP Trust and the Supplemental Benefit Plan shall be
operated and administered in a manner that will result in all contributions
by the Teams being fully deductible under the Code (and, where
applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid to the SBP Trust. If any
Team is disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part) for such
contributions, and unless the NBA determines otherwise, the obligation to
maintain the Supplemental Benefit Plan and to make further contributions
to the SBP Trust shall immediately terminate; provided, however, that any
such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other
provision of this Agreement, or the legally binding effect (if any) of any
other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it
create any right (1) to unilaterally implement, during the term of this
Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of benefits provided or to
be provided by the Supplemental Benefit Plan, (2) to lockout, or (3) to
strike.
(f) In the event of any termination pursuant to Section 3(e) above, the
NBA and the Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with
respect to an alternative arrangement designed to provide the benefits
described in the Supplemental Benefit Plan. Such alternative arrangement
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be funded by such monies
as may then remain in the SBP Trust and, if the monies remaining in the
SBP Trust may not lawfully be used for, or are insufficient for, such
purpose, such alternative arrangement shall be funded, by the NBA
Teams; provided that the annual cost incurred by the Teams in connection
with such alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis)
shall not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred to
fund the Supplemental Benefit Plan commencing on the date of
termination. Any such alternative arrangement shall be operated and
administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams
being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian
income tax laws) when paid; and, no matter how funded, the costs offunding for any alternative to the Supplemental Benefit Plan shall be
applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below,
shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is
available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(7) below, and shall be
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. If despite good faith
negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with
respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to
agree shall not create any right (1) to unilaterally implement, during the
term of this Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of benefits
provided or to be provided by the Supplemental Benefit Plan, (2) to
lockout, or (3) to strike.
(g) The terms of the Supplemental Benefit Plan shall permit
participation by Toronto Players on the same basis as players who are not
Toronto Players; provided, however, that a player shall not be eligible to
participate in the Supplemental Benefit Plan for the period of time during
which the player is a Canadian Resident. If either (1) the NBA and the
Players Association determine that the Supplemental Benefit Plan cannot
continue to provide benefits to Toronto Players that are substantially
equivalent to the benefits provided to players employed by Teams located
in the United States, or (2) a Toronto Player is a Canadian Resident, an
alternative arrangement acceptable to both the NBA and the Players
Association shall be established for Toronto Players or, if applicable, the
Canadian Resident, in lieu of the Supplemental Benefit Plan; provided that
the annual cost incurred by the Teams in connection with such alternative
arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall not exceed the
annual cost that such Teams would have incurred to fund the
Supplemental Benefit Plan for such Toronto Player or Canadian Resident.
The cost to Toronto of funding for any such alternative arrangement shall
be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8
below, shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any,
that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(7) below, and
shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.
Section 4. New Welfare and Post-Employment Benefit Plan.
Effective with the date of this Agreement, the NBA and the Players
Association shall cause to be established for the 2011-12 Season, and
continuing until the expiration or termination of this Agreement, a
program providing benefits including, but not limited to, new welfarebenefits, to be established and operated through a voluntary employees'
beneficiary association and related plan (the "New VEBA") and,
commencing no later than the 2012-13 Season, a post-employment annuity
benefit plan (the "PEP") as described in more detail below.
(a) (1) The New VEBA shall be established and maintained for the
purpose of providing benefits as permitted under Section
501(c)(9) of the Code (and the regulations issued thereunder) to
eligible vested players (using the same vesting rules as set forth
under the Supplemental Benefit Plan) and their dependents, in a
manner intended by the NBA and the Players Association to
qualify as a tax-exempt organization under the provisions of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. The terms of, and the benefits to
be provided under, the New VEBA shall be negotiated by the
NBA and the Players Association. The NBA and the Players
Association shall cooperate in seeking qualification of the New
VEBA as a tax-exempt organization and the New VEBA shall be
operated and administered so as to satisfy the requirements of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (and the regulations issued
thereunder). The daily operations of the New VEBA shall be
administered by an independent third-party administrator, as
selected by the NBA and the Players Association.
(2) The New VEBA shall be structured and maintained in a
manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being
fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian
tax laws) when paid to the New VEBA. If any Team is disallowed
a deduction (in whole or in part) for such contributions, and
unless the NBA determines otherwise, the obligation to maintain
and to make further contributions to the New VEBA shall
immediately terminate; provided, however, that any such
termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other
provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any)
of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining
agreement, nor shall it create any right (i) to unilaterally
implement, during the term of this Agreement, any terms
concerning the provision of benefits provided or to be provided
by the New VEBA, (ii) to lockout, or (iii) to strike.(3) In the event of any termination pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
above, the NBA shall provide an alternative arrangement for the
players. The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon
the type(s) of alternative arrangement to be provided. Such
alternative arrangement shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be funded by such monies as may then remain in
the New VEBA (or any trust holding contributions to such plan);
if the monies remaining in the New VEBA may not lawfully be
used for, or are insufficient for, such purpose, such alternative
arrangement shall be funded, by the Teams; provided the annual
cost incurred by the Teams in connection with funding such
alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall
not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred
to fund the New VEBA commencing on the date of termination.
Any such alternative arrangement shall be operated and
administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by
the Teams being fully deductible under the Code (and, where
applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid.
(b) (1) The PEP shall be established and maintained as a funded
non-tax-qualified program for the purpose of purchasing annuities
on behalf of Eligible Players (defined below) to provide a source
of post-employment income (notwithstanding the foregoing, the
NBA and the Players Association agree to meet and confer to
discuss structuring the PEP as an unfunded non-qualified
deferred compensation plan). The daily operations of the PEP
shall be administered by an independent third-party administrator,
as selected by the NBA and the Players Association.
(2) Eligibility. A player shall be eligible to participate in the
PEP for each "PEP Year" (November 1 through October 31)
coinciding with a Regular Season in which this Section 4 is in
effect (a "Covered Regular Season"), provided that he is eligible to
participate in the Supplemental Benefit Plan for that same Regular
Season and is on a Team's Roster for such Regular Season
("Eligible Player").
(3) PEP Benefit. For each Covered Regular Season, each
Eligible Player will receive a benefit under the PEP equal to an
amount to be negotiated between the NBA and PlayersAssociation for such Covered Regular Season (the "BRI
Deferral"). Commencing with the 2012-13 Season, in addition to
the BRI Deferral, the Base Compensation of such Eligible Players
for such Covered Regular Season shall be reduced by up to a
maximum of ten percent (10%); provided, however, that each
Eligible Player may elect a Base Compensation reduction of either
five percent (5%) or ten percent (10%) (the "Player Deferral" and,
collectively, with the BRI Deferral, the "PEP Benefit"); and
provided, further, that prior to each Covered Regular Season an
Eligible Player may opt out of the Player Deferral for that
Covered Regular Season by timely submitting written notice of
such election to the Eligible Player's Team. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, following the 2013-14 Season, the NBA and the
Players Association shall engage in good faith negotiations over
implementing the Player Deferral on a mandatory basis. The
NBA and the Players Association shall engage in good faith
negotiations over the procedures for implementing the Player
Deferral. An Eligible Player's PEP Benefit is expected to be
taxable as income to such Eligible Player and each Team will
report, and withhold from, such amount as it deems necessary to
satisfy any federal, state, local or other tax of any kind. The PEP
Benefit shall be used to purchase annuities for Eligible Players in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
in accordance with terms and conditions to be set forth in the
PEP ("PEP Annuities"). The amount of the PEP Benefit to be
applied toward the purchase of the PEP Annuities in respect of an
Eligible Player for a Covered Regular Season shall be the PEP
Benefit with respect to such Eligible Player for such Covered
Season less the amount of the Eligible Player's portion of any
applicable federal, state, local or other withholding taxes of any
kind attributable to the PEP Benefit (the "After-Tax PEP
Benefit"). Each Eligible Player will be fully vested in the PEP
Benefit and the PEP Annuities purchased on his behalf, and the
payments pursuant to the PEP Annuities shall become payable to
the player on the later of (i) the 12-month anniversary of the last
Regular Season game of the player's last Regular Season or (ii) the
6-month anniversary of the player's 30th birthday. At the Eligible
Player's election, the PEP Annuities will be payable in the form of
either (i) installment payments until the player attains age 50, (ii) asingle life annuity over the player's life, or (iii) a joint life annuity
paid over the player's life and his surviving spouse's life. In the
event of the death of a player prior to the commencement of
payments from a PEP Annuity, payments from such PEP Annuity
shall be made to the player's surviving spouse (or to the player's
designated beneficiary, if either the player is not married or the
surviving spouse consents to a non-spouse beneficiary) in a lump
sum as soon as practicable after the player's death. In the event
of the death of a player following commencement of payments
from a PEP Annuity, any remaining payments from such PEP
Annuity shall be payable to the player's surviving spouse (or the
player's designated beneficiary, if either the player is not married
or the surviving spouse consents to a non-spouse beneficiary), in
accordance with the player's payment election and the terms of
such PEP Annuity.
(4) Team Contributions. The obligation of the Teams to
provide benefits under the PEP for Eligible Players for a Covered
Regular Season shall be satisfied by the Teams (i) paying sums
into the PEP in the aggregate amount of the After-Tax PEP
Benefits on behalf of each of its Eligible Players, which shall be
made not later than September 1 following the end of the Regular
Season to which the PEP Benefit relates, and (ii) by remitting all
applicable withholding and payroll taxes attributable to such PEP
Benefit to the IRS and/or state and local taxing authorities. For
purposes of this Section, the applicable estimated federal, state
and local income taxes attributable to the PEP Benefit shall be
equal to the amount of the PEP Benefit multiplied by the sum of
the maximum federal, state and local income tax rates in effect in
the applicable locale for the calendar year in which the PEP
Benefit is made.
(5) Limitations on PEP.
(i) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement: (A) if
any change or amendment made to the Code or ERISA, or
to any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed
regulations), or rulings or formal guidance issued thereunder;
(B) if any interpretation, application or enforcement (or any
proposed interpretation, application or enforcement), by acourt of competent jurisdiction in the United States or by the
IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or any regulations or rulings issued
thereunder; (C) if any regulations (whether final, temporary
or proposed regulations), or rulings or formal guidance
issued by the IRS under the Code or ERISA; (D) if any
provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this
Section 4(b); or (E) if any other event or occurrence results in
the Teams being disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part)
for contributions made to the PEP for the tax year to which
the PEP Benefit relates, then any obligation to maintain the
PEP pursuant to this Agreement shall, at the option of the
NBA, terminate; provided, however, that any such
termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any
other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding
effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective
bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (x) to
unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any
terms concerning the provision of post-employment benefits
to the players, (y) to lockout, or (z) to strike.
(ii) If the PEP Benefit attributable to Eligible Players would
be subject to a federal income tax rate higher than the rate
that would apply if the PEP Benefit were paid as Base
Compensation, then any obligation to maintain the PEP
pursuant to this Agreement shall, at the option of the Players
Association, terminate; provided, however, that any such
termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any
other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding
effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective
bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (x) to
unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any
terms concerning the provision of post-employment benefits
to the players, (y) to lockout, or (z) to strike.
(iii) In the event of a termination described in Section
4(b)(5)(i) or (ii), the NBA shall provide an alternative
arrangement for the players. The NBA and the Players
Association shall agree upon the type(s) of alternative
arrangement to be provided, which shall be at an annual cost
(as determined on an after-tax basis) to the Teams equal tothe annual cost that such Teams would have incurred under
the PEP on the date of termination.
(c) For each Season, except as provided below, one percent (1%) of
BRI for such Season (the "Additional Benefit Amount") shall be used first
to fund the New VEBA (or any alternative arrangement) for that Season
and, to the extent any amount remains in the Additional Benefit Amount
after funding the New VEBA, to fund the BRI Deferral component of the
PEP (or any alternative arrangement) for that Season, unless the NBA and
the Players Association agree to a different funding priority between the
New VEBA and BRI Deferral component of the PEP. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, the Additional Benefit Amount for a Season shall
be subject to reduction or elimination pursuant to Article VII, Section
12(b)(1). For purposes of all calculations called for under this Agreement
of, or relating to, Benefits (including, but not limited to, for purposes of
(i) preparing the Audit Report, Interim Audit Report, or Interim Escrow
Audit Report, and (ii) calculating Total Benefits, Total Salaries and
Benefits, and Projected Benefits), the amount to be included with respect
to the Additional Benefit Amount shall be the full Additional Benefit
Amount specified in this Section 4(c) and not the reduced Additional
Benefit Amount provided for under Article VII, Section 12(b)(1).
(d) All costs of Professional Fees incurred in connection with the
implementation, operation and administration of the New VEBA (or any
attendant alternative arrangement) and PEP (or any attendant alternative
arrangement) shall be (i) paid by the Teams, (ii) applied against the New
Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, and (iii) limited to the
portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this
purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(6) below.
(e) The New VEBA and PEP shall be established and funded as forth
in this Section 4, provided, however that (i) this Section 4 does not by itself
create any other rights or obligations, and (ii) the specific benefits to be
provided under each such plan shall be governed by a definitive written
plan, agreement and/or other documentation implementing such plan(s).
Such documentation shall address the eligibility and participation of
Toronto Players and Canadian Residents in any such New VEBA and PEP
(or in any attendant alternative arrangement).Section 5. Labor-Management Cooperation and Education Trust.
(a) Except as set forth below in this Section 5, effective with the date
of this Agreement, and continuing for the duration thereof, the National
Basketball Players Association/National Basketball Association Labor-

shall continue to be jointly operated and administered by the NBA and the
Players Association in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement
and Declaration of Trust Establishing the National Basketball Players
Association/National Basketball Association Labor-Management
Cooperation and Education Trust (the "Education Trust Agreement"). It
is intended by the NBA and the Players Association that, at all times, the
Education Trust shall comply with the provisions of Section 302(c)(9) of
the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and shall
qualify as an exempt organization under the provisions of Section 501(c)(5)
or 501(c)(3) of the Code.
(b) The Education Trust shall continue to be operated and
administered for the purpose of establishing and providing (i) HIV/AIDS
education programs and (ii) education and career counseling programs
designed to assist the NBA, NBA Teams and NBA players in solving
problems of mutual concern not susceptible to resolution within the
collective bargaining process and to enhance the involvement of NBA
players in making decisions that affect their working lives.
(c) (1) Except as provided in Section 5(c)(2) below, the costs of
funding the Education Trust and the costs attributable to the
operation and administration of the Education Trust, including
the cost of Professional Fees incurred in connection with the
administration of the Education Trust, shall be paid by the Teams,
and (i) shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount, provided
for by Section 8 below, and (ii) shall be limited to the portion of
the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose
pursuant to Section 8(b)(5) below. Payment of the amount
necessary to fund the Education Trust in respect of each Salary
Cap Year shall be made within thirty (30) days following the
completion of the BRI Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.
The parties agree that, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 5, the amount to be paid by the Teams to fund the
education and career counseling programs to be operated andadministered by the Education Trust for the 2011-12 Salary Cap
Year shall be no greater than \$1,125,000 and such maximum
funding amount shall be increased by five percent (5%) for each
subsequent Salary Cap Year.
(2) The costs of funding the HIV/AIDS education programs to
be operated and administered by the Education Trust (or any
programs that, pursuant to Section 5(f) below, are substituted for
the HIV/AIDS education programs) shall be paid by the Teams.
Payment of the amount necessary to fund such programs in
respect of each Salary Cap Year shall be made within thirty (30)
days following the completion of the BRI Audit Report for such
Salary Cap Year. The parties agree that, subject to the limitations
set forth in this Section 5, the amount to be paid by the Teams to
fund the HIV/AIDS education programs (or any programs that,
pursuant to Section 5(f) below, are substituted for the HIV/AIDS
education programs) to be operated and administered by the
Education Trust for the 2011-12 Salary Cap Year shall be no
greater than \$350,000 and such maximum funding amount shall
be increased by five percent (5%) for each subsequent Salary Cap
Year.
(d) The Education Trust shall be operated and administered in a
manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully
deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax
laws) when paid. If any Team is disallowed a deduction (in whole or in
part) for such contributions, and unless the NBA determines otherwise,
the obligation to maintain the Education Trust and to make further
contributions to the Education Trust shall immediately terminate;
provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally
binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement, and shall not
create any right (1) to unilaterally implement, during the term of this
Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of education programs
provided or to be provided by the Education Trust, (2) to lockout, or
(3) to strike.
(e) In the event of any termination pursuant to Section 5(d) above, the
parties agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative
arrangement designed to provide the programs described in the Education
Trust Agreement. Such alternative arrangement shall, to the extentpermitted by applicable law, be funded by such monies as may then remain
in the Education Trust and, if the monies remaining in the Education
Trust may not lawfully be used for, or are insufficient for, such purpose,
such alternative arrangement shall be funded, by the NBA Teams;
provided, however, that the annual cost incurred by the Teams in
connection with such alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-
tax basis) shall not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have
incurred to fund the Education Trust commencing on the date of
termination. Any such alternative arrangement shall be operated and
administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams
being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian
income tax laws) when paid; and, no matter how funded, the costs of
funding for any alternative to the Education Trust shall be applied against
the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, shall be limited
to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this
purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(5) below, and shall be subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement. If despite good faith negotiations,
the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to an
alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not
create any right (1) to unilaterally implement, during the term of this
Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of programs provided or
to be provided by the Education Trust, (2) to lockout, or (3) to strike.
(f) Upon written notice delivered to the NBA at least six (6) months
prior to the commencement of any Salary Cap Year, the Players
Association may elect to terminate the programs currently provided by the
Education Trust and substitute alternative programs; provided, however,
that the NBA consents to such substitution, which such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld; and provided, further, that any new programs
shall comply with the provisions of Section 302(c)(9) of the Labor

policy or plan under this Section 6(d)(3) shall not impair the
legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement orthe legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any

agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association, or, absent such
agreement, the amount included in Benefits with respect to the 2010-11
Salary Cap Year.
